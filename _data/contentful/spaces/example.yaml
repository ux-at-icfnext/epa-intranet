  body: "####On This Page:  \n\nProcess \nRequirements for an ICR \n\n##Process \n\nThe
    process and time required to develop an ICR and get approval from OMB depends
    on whether the ICR is an initial or renewal ICR. Timing for initial ICRs that
    are rule-related is largely dependent on the timing of the rule-making and whether
    the rule is in the proposed or final stage. Development of new non-rule and renewal
    ICRs typically takes at least 6 months. The timelines and quick guides on the
    Types of ICRs webpage provide more information specific to each type of ICR. \n\nSee
    ICR Information Forms for an example of the information to prepare for the ICR
    Process. This information is required to change, reinstate, renew, or revise an
    ICR: \n\n##Requirements \n\n###What Does an ICR Package Contain? \n\nThe items
    that are required in an ICR package will depend on whether the ICR is for a new
    rule-related collection, a new non-rule collection, or a renewal of an existing
    collection (New Rule vs. New Non-Rule and Renewal ICRs). New rule-related ICR
    packages will contain a Supporting Statement and ICRAS form. ICR packages for
    new non-rule related collections and renewals will require a Supporting Statement,
    first and second Federal Register notices, and ICRAS forms. In addition, there
    are some other issues you should consider to ensure your collection conforms with
    other EPA standards and guidelines. Preparing an ICR package usually takes several
    months. It can include developing or updating a Supporting Statement, gathering
    public comments through the publication of a Federal Register notice, and completing
    ICRAS forms. The process can be time-consuming, often taking at least 6 months
    in the case of new non-rule and renewal ICRs. New rule ICRs can be somewhat less
    time-consuming. However, early preparation is the key to ensuring the ICR process
    does not hinder the timely collection of data. \n\nSee the following materials
    for more information. \n\nSupporting Statement: \n\nTo satisfy the requirements
    of the PRA and OMB's regulations, the Supporting Statement must clearly establish
    the need for and the use of the information, the advantages of the collection
    method(s) selected over alternative methods, and the estimated costs (both costs
    associated with the burden hours and capital costs) imposed on both respondents
    and Agency personnel by the collection. \n\nICRAS/ROCIS: \n\nThe Information Collections
    Request and Approval System (ICRAS), OEI’s online submission system, requires
    a summary of the detailed burden calculations contained in the Supporting Statement.
    The ICRAS template will help you gather the information required to be entered
    into ICRAS. Please be sure to read the instructions before completing both parts
    of the template. For additional information on using ICRAS or visit www.paperworkreduction.gov,
    contact your OEI Desk Officer. \n\nFederal Register Notices: \n\nFederal Register
    notices are used to solicit public comments and are required as part of the ICR
    package. For new non-rule and renewal ICRs, the program must prepare and publish
    a first Federal Register notice, soliciting public comments for 60 days (See Preparing
    Federal Register Notices). The Supporting Statement should contain a summary of
    the comments received and the actions taken in response to those comments. The
    program is also responsible for drafting a second Federal Register notice, which
    must be included in the ICR package submitted to OEI. OEI will publish the second
    FR notice once OEI’s review of the ICR package is complete. For rule-related ICRs,
    the Federal Register notice is published as part of the rule-making process. \n\nSee

      in the economic analysis. This is especially important where information costs
      are a significant fraction of the total regulatory or compliance costs. The
      analyst preparing the ICR, and his or her counterpart working on the EA, should
      have in mind the same program model and cost elements. The costs associated
      with creating, collecting, maintaining, and reporting information are a subset
      of the entire cost of the regulation.\n"

      Forms Requirements__\n__Additional Considerations when Developing or Renewing
      an ICR__\n\nEPA, like all other Federal agencies, is rapidly moving into the
      electronic information age. The increased use of information technology is quickly
      becoming a part of how EPA does business. EPA is committed to meeting the changing
      demands of a technology-centered society and has developed new standards and
      tools to improve the efficiency and quality of its information. As new collections
      are planned and existing ones renewed through the ICR process, it is important
      to ensure that all new requirements are met.\n\nTo learn more about EPA data
      standards, quality considerations, and other requirements you should be aware
      of, see the following information.\n\n##New Non-Rulemaking\n\nAn initial (new)
      ICR may be either rule-related or non-rule-related. A rule-related ICR corresponds
      to the promulgation of a regulation that requires the collection of information.
      A non-rule ICR usually refers to a survey or a voluntary program, such as EPA's
      Energy Star programs, that is not associated with a specific rulemaking.\n\nAn
      initial ICR is an ICR that is being submitted to OMB for the approval of a new
      collections. If EPA wishes to begin a new collection of information, an ICR
      must be submitted to and approved by OMB before the collections of information
      may begin. An initial ICR must discuss projected benefits and costs, which are
      usually based an estimates and analogies to similar colections.\n\nA renewal
      ICR is an ICR that is being submitted to OMB for re-approval of an existing
      information collection. OMB approval of an ICR is granted for a maximum of three
      years, so EPA must renew any ICR for which continued compliance is required.
      If EPA wishes to continue collecting the information past the three year approval,
      an ICR renewal package must be submitted to OMB for approval prior to the current
      expiration date. A renewal ICR must discuss the differences between original
      expectations, as embodied in the new ICR, and actual collection experiences
      and results. The renewal must also respond to any Terms of Clearance issued
      by OMB in the previous approval. The renewal process is the same for both rule-related
      and non-rule ICRs.\n\n##New Rulemaking\n\n__Proposed ICRs__\nA Proposed Rule
      ICR is an ICR that is associated with new regulations. Not all rules have new
      information collections, but many do. Any time there is a new rule where EPA
      will collect new information from the public, the agency will need to submit
      the accompanying ICR to OMB. A Final Rule ICR will need to be submitted to OMB
      for approval before the rule becomes effective. Learn more.\n\nTiming and process
      for initial rule-related ICRs\n The process and time required to develop an
      ICR and get approval from OMB depends on whether the ICR is an initial or renewal
      ICR. Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent on the
      timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or final stage.
      Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at least 6 months.
      The timelines and quick guides below provide more information specific to each
      type of ICR.\n\n__Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)__\nA Notice of Proposed
      Rulemaking (NPRM), also known as a Proposed Rule, is an announcement of proposed
      new regulations or modifications to existing regulations that is published in
      the Federal Register. An NRPM seeks public comments on the proposed rulemaking.
      For proposed rules, an ICR package containing the Supporting Statement and completed
      ICRAS forms must be submitted to your OEI Desk Officer at least one month prior
      to the proposed rule being published in the Federal Register. OEI will then
      submit the ICR to OMB on the day the proposed rule is published in the Federal
      Register.\n\nWhen an ICR is prepared for a NPRM, specific language is required
      in the preamble of the rule.\n\n__Steps to Create Proposed Rule ICR__\nWrite
      the supporting statement for the proposed rule.\nFill in the Paperwork Reduction
      Act section of the rule preamble.\nSend supporting statement and ICR Submission
      Worksheet to ICR Desk Officer for review at least 1 month before it needs to
      go to OMB.\nAfter the Administrator signs the Proposed Rule, notify OEI of when
      it is expected to publish. This is so that OEI will be able to submit the ICR
      to OMB on the day that it publishes in the Federal Register.\nOne month in advance
      of the proposed rule publishing, add all documents including the supporting
      statement and any forms to the Federal Docket Management System, FDMS. For questions
      on FDMS, please contact the Docket Center.\nOMB reviews and files comments on
      Proposed Rule ICR.\nProgram office develops ICR for Final Rule and sends their
      ICR Desk Officer the package for review.\nSubmit the ICR to OMB. This step most
      commonly takes place on the day the final rule gets published.\n\n__Final Rule
      ICRs__\nA final rule sets out new or revised requirements and their effective
      date. A final rule also may remove requirements. When preceded by a Notice of
      Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), a final rule will also identify significant substantive
      issues raised by commenters in response to the NPRM and will give the agency's
      response. Final rules are often codified in the Code of Federal Regulations
      (CFR).\n\nWhether an ICR package is required for the final rule depends on several
      factors.\n\nIf OMB pre-approves the ICR for the proposed rule and the final
      rule does not change information requirements, then an ICR is not necessary
      for the final rule. Instead the Program Office must submit an estimate of the
      burden hours and costs to OEI.\nIf OMB does not pre-approve the ICR for the
      proposed rule or information requirements have changed since the proposed rule,
      then an ICR is required.\nIf an ICR is required, an ICR package must be submitted
      to your OEI Desk Officer at least three months prior to the final rule being
      published in the Federal Register. This will allow the ICR package to be submitted
      OMB at the same time the final rule is sent for to OMB for review. The ICR will
      then already have been approved when the rule is promulgated and the 40 CFR
      Part 9 Table can be amended to include the OMB approval number.\n\nWhen an ICR
      is prepared for a final rule, specific language is required in the preamble
      of the rule.\n\n__Steps to Create Final Rule ICR__\nModify the supporting statement
      as needed.\nModify the preamble as needed.\nRule goes to OMB for review. After
      OMB finishes their review, make any modifications needed to the ICR and send
      the rule preamble, ICR Submission Worksheet, and supporting statement to your
      ICR Desk Officer for review. The Final Rule ICR package should be submitted
      to OEI for review at least 3 months before it needs to go to OMB.\nEPA needs
      to submit the Final Rule ICR to OMB 60 days before the effective date so that
      OMB has enough time to review the ICR. Typically OEI will submit the ICR to
      OMB on the day that the final rule publishes in the Federal Register. However,
      if the publishing date is less than 60 days until the effective date, then OEI
      will need to submit the ICR to OMB prior to publication.\n\n##Revision\n\nICRs
      are typically valid for 3 years. If a program would like to change anything
      that was in their OMB approved ICR, they may submit a revision package. Examples
      of when to revise an ICR:\n\n- Consolidate several ICRs into one\n- Change a
      form\n- Add a new form\n\n##New Collection Information Forms\n\n[insert links
      to the forms]\n\n##Generic ICR\n\n__What is the Generic ICR?__\nA tool to obtain
      expedited OMB clearance for low-burden customer service satisfaction surveys
      without the time and effort required to create a\n\"\"standard\"\" Information
      Collection Request.\n\nSatisfaction surveys have been cleared under this generic
      ICR for collections such as:\n\n- Conferences/Workshops\n- EPA Websites, Publications
      and Data Systems\n- Community/Industry Outreach and Education Programs\n- Help
      Desks and Processing Centers\n- Focus Groups\n\n__How can the Generic ICR help
      me?__\n- 5-day turnaround at OMB\n- No public notice and comment requirements\n-
      Simplified Supporting Statement\n- Quick processing and approval time\n\n__General
      Guidelines__\n\nEach question and the survey structure should be designed to
      elicit responses that are useful to improve products or services. \n- Is each
      question designed to gather information that you will be able to act upon?\n-
      Keep the survey short and simple, in recognition that a respondent's time is
      limited.\n- Most accurate responses require that questions are ordered to first
      focus on the product or service. After these types of questions are completed,
      an optional second set of questions could identify characteristics of the respondent.\n-
      Questions should be non-duplicative, both of other surveys that already exist
      and of questions within the same survey.\n- Scales should have a midpoint to
      allow for a neutral response, and also a N/A option.\n- Any demographic questions
      should be placed at the end of the survey.\n- Responses and data received should
      be used for internal purposes only and not aggregated to make external claims.\n-
      Both qualitative and quantitative questions may be asked, however, any statistical
      methods used must be explained in the justification.\n\n__What surveys are covered
      by the Generic ICR?__\nOnly those surveys which measure satisfaction with agency
      services qualify to use this ICR. In addition, the survey must meet the following
      requirements:\n\n- The collection is voluntary.\n- The collection is low-burden
      for respondents and low-cost for the Federal Government.\n- The collection is
      non-controversial and does not raise issues of concern to other federal agencies.\n-
      The results are not intended to be disseminated to the public.\nInformation
      gathered will not be used for the purpose of substantially informing influential
      policy decisions.\n- The collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions
      from respondents who have experience with the program or may have experience
      with the program in the future.\n- Please note that questions whose goal is
      to seek to evaluate the effectiveness or impacts of a program rather than a
      customer's opinions or experience are not within the scope of the generic ICR.\n\n__Which
      formats can I use to collect the data?__\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act applies
      regardless of the medium used to collect information, as such the generic ICR
      can be used for surveys conducted by:\n- Internet, including social media platforms
      (ForSee, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Facebook, EPA website, email)\n- Telephone\n-
      In-person or on-site (conference & workshop evaluations, interviews, focus groups)\n-
      Mail (traditional surveys, comment cards)\n\nOther, may include:\n- Customer
      satisfaction surveys\n- Customer comment card/Complaint forms\n- Usability testing
      (website, software)\n- Focus groups\n- Small discussion groups\n\n__What types
      of questions can I ask?__\n- Yes/No\n- Directed Responses (drop-down menus,
      radio buttons, polls)\n- Ratings\n- Free response (text box)\n\n####Fast Track\n\n####Generic
      Customer Service Satisfaction Survey\n\n####Justification\n\nWhen creating a
      new generic customer service satisfaction survey, you will need to write up
      a justification explaining what information you are going to collect and how
      long it will take for the public to respond. Use the Justification Template
      to describe the survey. Learn more.\n\n####Approval\n\nNew generic survey requests
      should be e-mailed to an ICR Desk Officer in OEI.\n\nSteps in the process:\n\nReview
      the guidance and samples provided on this webpage. Contact an OEI Desk Officer
      if you have additional questions.\nEmail a completed Justification Template
      along with a copy of your survey questions to an OEI Desk Officer.\nOEI will
      review the package and, if necessary, reply with comments.\nOnce the package
      is completed to everyone s satisfaction, the OEI team will transmit the new
      generic request to OMB.\nOMB has 5 business days to review the package. By the
      end of that period, OMB will have either responded will questions or additional
      requests, rejected the collection, approved the collection, or not-responded
      at all -- in which case the generic collection is approved by default. If you
      do not hear from your OEI Desk Officer by the end of the 5 business day review
      period, contact them to ascertain the status of your proposed generic collection.\n\n####Templates

  body: "####On This Page: \n\nWhat is an ICR?\nWhat is covered in an ICR?\nIs an
    ICR Necessary?\nExemptions\nExamples of When an ICR is Required\n\n##What is an
    ICR?\nAn Information Collection Request (ICR) is a set of documents that describe
    reporting, record keeping, survey, or other information collection requirements
    imposed on the public by the Environmental Protection Agency.  A new information
    collection may be a survey, interview, focus group, form, or anything else that
    would ask the public to report or record information. Each request must be sent
    to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget before a collection begins.
    The ICR provides an overview of the collection, and estimates the cost and time
    for the public to respond. The public may view an ICR and submit comments on the
    ICR at any time.\n\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act stipulates that every federal
    agency must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before
    collecting the same or similar information from 10 or more members of the public.
    If EPA decides to gather such information, the appropriate program office must
    prepare an Information Collection Request (ICR) and submit it to the appropriate
    OCI Desk Officer.\n\nAfter reviewing the ICR, OMB may approve or disapprove the
    ICR. Alternatively, OMB may create conditions that must be met before the ICR
    is approved. This process was designed to prevent unnecessary collections and
    reduce costs. \n\nExamples of information collections include surveys, permit
    applications, questionnaires, standardized data collection, and reports.\n\n##What
    is covered in an ICR?\nAn Information Collection Request must include:\n* A description
    of the information to be collected\n* The reason the information is needed\n*
    An estimate of the time and cost for the public to answer the request.\n\nSee
    the Instruments page for more information (What does an ICR package contain?)\n\n##Is
    an ICR Necessary?\nAn ICR is required if the same or similar information is being
    collected from 10 or more non\\-Federal respondents within a 12-month period,
    even if the information collection is voluntary. Generally, any monitoring, reporting,
    or recordkeeping requirement imposed on non-Federal respondents by EPA will require
    an ICR. Surveys and questionnaires may also require an ICR. Additionally, information
    collections associated with all cooperative agreements and many grants require
    an ICR. When an ICR is required, it must be approved by OMB before the collection
    begins, regardless of whether the collection of information is mandatory, voluntary,
    or required to receive a benefit.\nTo assist you in determining whether an ICR
    is needed, review the ICR decision tree for examples of when an ICR is needed.
    When deciding whether to renew an ICR, ask your program office if the information
    still needs to be collected. If the information will no longer be collected, do
    not renew the ICR. For additional guidance, consult your OEI Desk Officer.\n\n###When
    do Cooperative Agreements and Grants Need an ICR?\nThe process and time required
    to develop an ICR and get approval from OMB depends on whether the ICR is an initial
    or renewal ICR. Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent
    on the timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or final
    stage. Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at least 6
    months. The timelines and quick guides below provide more information specific
    to each type of ICR.\n• ICR request and approval process\n\n###Exemptions\nEPA
    has promulgated a rule that provides the regulated community with the possibility
    of exemption from a regulation. In order to receive the exemption, the facility
    must submit a letter requesting the exemption, with the appropriate supporting
    documentation, to the Regional Administrator.\n\nAn ICR is required for the exemption
    requirement. EPA generally requests ICR approval from OMB when a rule is promulgated
    (as part of the regulation development process). Neither the purpose of the collection
    nor the voluntary manner of a submission is relevant to the need for an ICR. An
    ICR is required for an exemption or waiver. EPA requires a contractor to develop
    a questionnaire on waste types and quantities. The contractor is not directed
    to do any further work. An EPA employee wants to send the questionnaire to 10
    or more companies.\n##Examples of When an ICR is Required\nIs this a request for
    information, recordkeeping, reporting, or other standardized data collection activity
    sponsored by EPA? This includes activities that involve the disclosure of information
    by third parties directly to non-Federal entities.\n•\tEPA has promulgated a rule

    an ICR is needed.\n\n•\tAn EPA employee or a contractor needs to request and use
    data from a report or booklet developed by an organization containing information
    collected from its industry. The organization produced the report or booklet for
    its own purposes.\no\tBecause EPA did not direct or participate in the collection
    of the information, and because the request is directed to a single organization
    only, an ICR is not necessary. However, the source of the information should be
    noted in any document produced. Note: If EPA develops the questions for the collection,
    sponsors the collection (e.g., via a cooperative agreement), or collects the information,
    an ICR is required.\n\n•\tEPA approaches a trade association and requests that
    the association poll its membership for input concerning an EPA project. The total
    number of respondents is greater than ten. \no\tEven though the trade association

    of a public water system's failure to meet applicable national drinking water
    standards. The regulation will list various mechanisms for providing public notification
    such as newspaper notices, mailing notices, or submitting a press release to TV
    and/or radio stations.\no\tAn ICR is required because the EPA regulation requires

    body1: "##Goals & Inventory\n\n##Requirements\n__What Does an ICR Package Contain?__\n\nThe
      items that are required in an ICR package will depend on whether the ICR is
      for a new rule-related collection, a new non-rule collection, or a renewal of
      an existing collection. New rule-related ICR packages will contain a Supporting
      Statement and ICRAS form. ICR packages for new non-rule related collections
      and renewals will require a Supporting Statement, first and second Federal Register
      notices, and ICRAS forms. In addition, there are some other issues you should
      consider to ensure your collection conforms with other EPA standards and guidelines.\n\nPreparing
      an ICR package usually takes several months. It can include developing or updating
      a Supporting Statement, gathering public comments through the publication of
      a Federal Register notice, and completing ICRAS forms. The process can be time-consuming,
      often taking at least 6 months in the case of new non-rule and renewal ICRs.
      New rule ICRs can be somewhat less time-consuming. However, early preparation
      is the key to ensuring the ICR process does not hinder the timely collection
      of data.\n\nSee the following materials for more information.\n\n__Supporting
      Statement__:\n- To satisfy the requirements of the PRA and OMB's regulations,
      the Supporting Statement must clearly establish the need for and the use of
      the information, the advantages of the collection method(s) selected over alternative
      methods, and the estimated costs (both costs associated with the burden hours
      and capital costs) imposed on both respondents and Agency personnel by the collection.\n\n__ICRAS
      Forms__:\n- The Information Collections Request and Approval System (ICRAS),
      OEI’s online submission system, requires a summary of the detailed burden calculations
      contained in the Supporting Statement. The ICRAS template will help you gather
      the information required to be entered into ICRAS. Please be sure to read the
      instructions before completing both parts of the template. For additional information
      on using ICRAS or visit www.paperworkreduction.gov, contact your OEI Desk Officer.\n\n__Federal
      Register Notices__:\n- Federal Register notices are used to solicit public comments
      and are required as part of the ICR package. For new non-rule and renewal ICRs,
      the program must prepare and publish a first Federal Register notice, soliciting
      public comments for 60 days. The Supporting Statement should contain a summary
      of the comments received and the actions taken in response to those comments.
      The program is also responsible for drafting a second Federal Register notice,
      which must be included in the ICR package submitted to OEI. OEI will publish
      the second FR notice once OEI’s review of the ICR package is complete. For rule-related
      ICRs, the Federal Register notice is published as part of the rule-making process.\n\n__How
      do I submit an ICR package to OEI for review and submission to OMB?__\n\n##Forms\n\nIf
      respondents must fill out a form, questionnaire, survey, or other written collection
      of information as part of your ICR, you must submit a copy of the form along
      with your ICR package.\n\nTo initiate the process of developing an external
      public use form or revising an existing form, form owners should contact the
      External Public Use Forms Officer well in advance of the time that the form
      needs to be used. Guidance will be provided as well as a form number (if it
      is a new form) once a completed Form Action Request has been received by the
      __External Public Use Forms Officer__. The form owner must develop and/or update
      the form in accordance with the __Forms Design Specifications__. It must adhere
      to the Design Specifications, including correct use of the EPA logo, and must
      display the EPA Form Number, OMB Control Number, and burden statement. Once
      the form is complete, it is submitted as part of the ICR package for review
      prior to submission to OMB.  Forms may not be used or distributed until OMB
      approval is received.\n\nTo obtain more information, you can visit the [FormSmart
      website](http://intranet.epa.gov/forms), or send an e-mail to externalforms@epa.gov.\n\nYou
      can also obtain information directly from your __Program Office's Forms Liaison__.\n\n##Submission
      Worksheet\n__Why Fill it Out?__\nThe information requested in the worksheet
      mirrors the information that OMB requires with all ICR submissions. Your ICR
      Desk Officer will transfer the data in the worksheet into OMB's ICR submission
      system.\n\n__ICR Template__\nThe __ICR Submission Worksheet__ gets included
      with the ICR package that is submitted to OEI. Please fill out the boxes in
      the worksheet so that your Desk Officer will able to submit the ICR package
      to OMB.\n__Learn more.__\n\n__ICRAS__\nOnce the ICR package has been compiled,
      you will need to submit it to your __OEI Desk Officer__. All ICRs must be submitted
      to OEI through the Information Collection Request and Approval System (ICRAS),
      EPA's on-line ICR submission system. Before submitting the ICR package to OEI,
      you should review the following checklist to make sure everything is in order.
      Once the ICR is submitted to OEI, your OEI desk officer will review it before
      submitting the ICR to OMB for approval.\n\n##Help and Contacts\n__Who approves
      an ICR?__\nEach request must be sent to and approved by the Office of Management
      and Budget before a collection begins. The ICR provides an overview of the collection,
      and estimates the cost and time for the public to respond. The public may view
      an ICR and submit comments on the ICR at any time.\n\n##508\n\n##Records\n\n##Privacy

      ##1st Notice

      The 1st Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with an ICR's data and published in the Federal Register. The notice is posted for 60 days.

      ##2nd Notice

      The 2nd Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with the ICR's data and then is submitted to OEI for publishing. This notice is posted for 30 days. Learn more.

      ##FR Process for New ICR

      For a new ICR that is not part of a rulemaking, follow the same process as the renewal ICRs.

      ##FR Process for Proposed Rule

      For proposed rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list any new information collection requirements. Proposed rules with new information collections follow Template A of the rule preamble guidance.

      ##FR Process for Final Rule

      For final rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list the EPA ICR number as well as the assigned OMB control number. Final Rules may follow either one of the templates in the rule preamble guidance.

      ##FR Process for Renewals

      Nine months prior to an ICR's expiration date, programs should begin working on their renewal packages.
      - Start going over the previous collection by talking with a few respondents to get a feel for the current levels of burden estimates.
      - Begin adjusting the burden hours, responses, and salary costs in the supporting statement to current levels.
      - Draft the 1st FR Notice with the ICR's current data.
      - Submit the 1st FR Notice and Typesetting Request Form to the FR Office (contacts listed on right, or send them an e-mail).
      - 1st FR Notice should publish 6 months prior to ICR's expiration date.
      - After the 1st FR Notice publishes, finalize the renewal package by completing the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.

      ##General FAQ

      __Why do I need to contact the Federal Register Office?__
      For a renewal of an Information Collection Request, program offices publish the 1st Federal Register Notice at least 6 months prior to the ICR's expiration date. The current templates are available on the Federal Register Notices page. For the 2nd Federal Register notice, program offices complete the notice and email it, along with the rest of their ICR package, to their ICR Desk Officer. For ICR renewals, this step would take place between 3 and 4 months prior to the ICR's expiration date.

      __How do I publish a Federal Register Notice?__
      For the 1st Federal Register Notice, fill out the 1st FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Then, submit the 1st FR Notice, a Typesetting Request, and an Action Information Sheet to the Office of Policy s, Office of the Federal Register (OFR). See their Federal Register Publishing intranet site for more details, templates, and contact information.
      For the 2nd Federal Register Notice, fill out the 2nd FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.

    \n\n[Is an ICR Necessary?](url) \n\n[Exemptions](url) \n\n[Examples of When an
    ICR is Required](url) \n\n---\n\n##What is an ICR? \n\nAn Information Collection
    Request (ICR) is a set of documents that describe reporting, record keeping, survey,
    or other information collection requirements imposed on the public by the Environmental
    Protection Agency.  A new information collection may be a survey, interview, focus
    group, form, or anything else that would ask the public to report or record information.
    Each request must be sent to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget
    before a collection begins. The ICR provides an overview of the collection, and
    estimates the cost and time for the public to respond. The public may view an
    ICR and submit comments on the ICR at any time. \n\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act
    stipulates that every federal agency must obtain approval from the Office of Management
    and Budget (OMB) before collecting the same or similar information from 10 or
    more members of the public. If EPA decides to gather such information, the appropriate
    program office must prepare an Information Collection Request (ICR) and submit
    it to the appropriate OCI Desk Officer. \n\nAfter reviewing the ICR, OMB may approve
    or disapprove the ICR. Alternatively, OMB may create conditions that must be met
    before the ICR is approved. This process was designed to prevent unnecessary collections
    and reduce costs.  \n\n__What happens if EPA does not obtain OMB approval for
    an information collection?__\n\nExamples of information collections include surveys,
    permit applications, questionnaires, standardized data collection, and reports.
    \n\n##What is covered in an ICR? \n\nAn Information Collection Request must include:
    \n\n- A description of the information to be collected \n\n- The reason the information
    is needed \n\n- An estimate of the time and cost for the public to answer the
    request. \n\n- See the Instruments page for more information (What does an ICR
    package contain?) \n\n##Is an ICR Necessary? \n\nAn ICR is required if the same
    or similar information is being collected from 10 or more non-Federal respondents
    within a 12-month period, even if the information collection is voluntary. Generally,
    any monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirement imposed on non-Federal
    respondents by EPA will require an ICR. Surveys and questionnaires may also require
    an ICR. Additionally, information collections associated with all cooperative
    agreements and many grants require an ICR. When an ICR is required, it must be
    approved by OMB before the collection begins, regardless of whether the collection
    of information is mandatory, voluntary, or required to receive a benefit. \n\nTo
    assist you in determining whether an ICR is needed, review the __ICR decision
    tree__ for examples of when an ICR is needed. When deciding whether to renew an
    ICR, ask your program office if the information still needs to be collected. If
    the information will no longer be collected, do not renew the ICR. For additional
    guidance, consult your __OEI Desk Officer__. \n\n__When do Cooperative Agreements
    and Grants Need an ICR?__ \n\nThe process and time required to develop an ICR
    and get approval from OMB depends on whether the ICR is an __initial__ or __renewal
    ICR__. Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent on the
    timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or final stage.
    Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at least 6 months.
    The timelines and quick guides below provide more information specific to each
    type of ICR. \n\n[ICR request and approval process](insert media) \n\n##Exemptions
    \n\nEPA has promulgated a rule that provides the regulated community with the
    possibility of exemption from a regulation. In order to receive the exemption,
    the facility must submit a letter requesting the exemption, with the appropriate
    supporting documentation, to the Regional Administrator. \n\nAn ICR is required
    for the exemption requirement. EPA generally requests ICR approval from OMB when
    a rule is promulgated (as part of the regulation development process). Neither
    the purpose of the collection nor the voluntary manner of a submission is relevant
    to the need for an ICR. An ICR is required for an exemption or waiver. EPA requires
    a contractor to develop a questionnaire on waste types and quantities. The contractor
    is not directed to do any further work. \n\n##Examples of When an ICR is Required
    \n\n- The contractor may develop a questionnaire without prior ICR approval. However,
    if EPA plans to send the questionnaire to 10 or more companies an ICR is needed.
    \n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor needs to request and use data from a report
    or booklet developed by an organization containing information collected from
    its industry. The organization produced the report or booklet for its own purposes.
    Because EPA did not direct or participate in the collection of the information,
    and because the request is directed to a single organization only, an ICR is not
    necessary. However, the source of the information should be noted in any document
    produced. \n\n*Note: If EPA develops the questions for the collection, sponsors
    the collection (e.g., via a cooperative agreement), or collects the information,
    an ICR is required. *\n\n- EPA approaches a trade association and requests that
    the association poll its membership for input concerning an EPA project. The total
    number of respondents is greater than ten. \n\n- Even though the trade association
    is collecting the information, an ICR is required because comments are in fact
    solicited by EPA from 10 or more respondents. \n\n- EPA approaches a trade association
    and requests comments, input or other information pertaining to an EPA project.
    The trade association provides the information to EPA from data in its existing
    files. \n\n- An ICR is not required because the association obtained the information
    from its existing files and did not conduct a poll or survey to obtain the information.
    If EPA asked the association to perform a poll or survey, then an ICR would be
    required. \n\n- EPA plans to promulgate a regulation that requires public notification
    of a public water system's failure to meet applicable national drinking water
    standards. The regulation will list various mechanisms for providing public notification
    such as newspaper notices, mailing notices, or submitting a press release to TV
    and/or radio stations. \n\n- An ICR is required because the EPA regulation requires
    disclosure of information to parties other than the Federal government which falls
    under the PRA third-party disclosure provision. \n\n---\n\n##Other Webpages \n\nInstruments

    body1: "##On This Page\n\n---\n\n##10+ Recipients\n\nAnytime a federal agency
      wants to collect similar information from 10 or more members of the public,
      the Paperwork Reduction Act requires that the agency first obtain OMB approval
      for the new collection. A new information collection may be a survey, interview,
      focus group, form, or anything else that would ask the public to report or record
      information. Learn more about new, non-rule related ICRs.\n\n__Are you requesting
      \"substantially similar\" information or posing identical questions to 10 or
      more respondents?__\n\nRequesting 10 or more respondents to provide the same
      level of information on the same subject would be considered as asking identical
      questions under the PRA and requires an ICR. For example: \n\n- An EPA employee
      or contractor needs to request information on solid waste regulations from 10
      or more States. The employee or contractor intends to call each State to get
      clarification of the regulations and ask each State to assemble and provide
      additional new information on the implementation of the regulations.\n\n- An
      EPA employee and a contractor need to attend a trade association meeting of
      10 or more industry representatives to discuss EPA and industry perspectives
      on general issues concerning special waste generation and management.\n\nGeneral
      observations and participation in general discussions do not require an ICR.
      The EPA employee or contractor must NOT use a list of standardized questions
      or ask the respondents to reply to identical questions during the meeting.\n\n-
      An EPA employee or a contractor needs to develop a list of questions on hazardous
      waste generation and management in preparation for a meeting with 10 or more
      representatives of different non-federal organizations. The employee or contractor
      then obtains answers to the questions from each of the representatives either
      at the meeting or as a follow-up.\n\nAn ICR is required. This goes beyond having
      a general discussion and would entail collecting substantially similar information
      from 10 or more non-federal respondents.\n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor
      needs to collect information from 7 separate State agencies and 4 Counties.
      The State agencies will be requested to provide information on discrete aspects
      of their municipal waste management regulatory authorities. The information
      requested from Counties will focus on different aspects of their recycling programs.\n\nAn
      ICR will not be required for this project if the information collected from
      the two groups is substantially different and there is no substantial overlap.\n\n##Public
      Audiences\n\nAll Cooperative Agreements that collect information from the public
      (including state, local, and tribal governments) must have an OMB approved ICR.\n\nGrants
      may or may not need an ICR. A grant needs an ICR if EPA directs the collection
      of information in any way. An example might be if EPA gives a grant and instructs
      the recipient to do a survey. A grant may not need an ICR if EPA is simply giving
      a grant to an institution and not directing the work in any way. Not sure if
      the EPA is sponsoring a grantee's collection? Give your __OEI Desk Officer__
      a call.\n\n##General Applicability\n- An EPA employee or a contractor needs
      to obtain copies of existing solid waste regulations from 10 or more States\n\n-
      An ICR is not required for an information collection that is considered a customary
      business practice.\n\n- Providing EPA with a copy of material in its existing
      format, which is generally made available upon request (in this instance, the
      regulations), requires no new intellectual effort or burden and would fall under
      the category of customary business practice.\n\n- Any burden for preparing,
      keeping, or reporting information is exempt from further burden and cost analysis
      if the information is already prepared, kept, or reported as part of usual or
      customary business practice. If it is determined that your request is a Customary
      Business Practice, no ICR would be needed.\n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor
      needs to gather information on certain products, such as how they are packaged
      and what types of wastes are produced in the manufacture of these products and
      after product use. The company has brochures and Material Safety Data Sheets
      (MSDS) on these products and a report on a waste survey of its members. This
      material is available to the public upon request.\n\n- An ICR is not needed
      for product brochures, MSDS sheets or the survey results provided in existing
      formats. An ICR would be needed to collect new data on the types and quantities
      of wastes or packaging data or for re-assembling existing data in a new format.\n\n##Market

      ##Social Media Exceptions

      __Background__

      The PRA was created to protect the public from burdensome, unnecessary, low-utility or duplicative Federal requests for information. While the PRA never envisioned how government would use technological developments such as social media, these decidedly non-paperwork-related technologies are nonetheless subject to the provisions of the Act, which applies “regardless of form or format.”

      Prior approval must be obtained from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before EPA can ask for most types of information from the public. Approval is obtained through submission of an Information Collection Request (ICR), which is generally a substantial undertaking that requires 6-9 months on average to complete.

      However, not all public responses to agency solicitations constitute “information collections” depending on their format and use. Many (though not all) uses of social media fall outside the scope of the PRA, as outlined below. These same guidelines may also be applied to questions asked in traditional off-line formats, which may be structured so as to avoid the need for an ICR.

      ICRs are required whenever identical or substantially similar information is gathered by or for EPA from 10 or more non-Federal entities, regardless of whether a collection is voluntary or mandatory. As social media uses are open to large numbers of people, ICRs can only be avoided if either of the following are true: The solicitation does not seek “identical” information, or qualify as “information” (per OMB’s definition).

      __Tips for Avoiding an ICR__

        - Do Not Request “Information”
      OMB has specifically stated that submissions made via many social media platforms do not quality as "information" because they fall under longstanding exemptions for:

         - General Solicitations. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(4) excludes "facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations of comments from the public, published in the Federal Register or other publications, regardless of the form or format thereof, provided that no person is required to supply specific information pertaining to the commenter, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a condition of the agency’s full consideration of the comment."
       - Public Meetings. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(8) excludes certain "facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with public hearings or meetings."
      Like Items. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(10) reserves general authority for OMB to identify other "like items" that are not "information."
       - __OMB's Guidance on Social Media memo__ provides greater detail, but in brief, public comments or submissions made via the following social media platforms generally fall under the exemptions above and DO NOT require an ICR (within the stated limitations).

      OMB defines as “identical” those questions for which each respondent or group of respondents (e.g., in a focus group) is being asked to provide the same level of information on the same subject. Identical questions need not be phrased exactly the same way each time they are asked, nor does each respondent need to be asked the same “set of questions.” For this reason, we often characterize “identical” as meaning “substantially similar”.

      The following “creative” attempts to circumvent this definition are not valid and require an ICR:

      Rephrasing questions for different respondents.
      Breaking up a list of questions among 10 or more respondents so that each question is only asked of 9 or fewer respondents.
      Enlisting surrogates (such as Regions, States, Contractors or Grantees) to each gather the information from 9 or fewer people. (e.g. even if 10 Regions each ask 5 people the same question, it counts as 50 respondents).

      __How can I collect information without having to do an ICR?__

      The Social Media Guide provides some creative ways to collect information without triggering the need for an ICR.

      The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that any federal agency collecting similar information from 10 or more members of the public will require an OMB approved ICR. So, one way you can collect that information is by contacting fewer than 10 respondents. Another option available is to hold a public meeting where you can ask for general solicitation."
      "How to Ask Questions and Use Social Media Without Triggering an Information Collection Request (Word)
      “The PRA defines and uses ‘collection of information’ very broadly  to mean ‘the obtaining, causing to be obtained, solicitation or requiring the disclosure to third parties or the public’ of facts of opinions ‘regardless of the form or format’ used. ”Implementing Guidance for OMB Review of Agency Information Collection, June 2, 1999, Discussion of what is not considered “information” is contained on pages 23-28.

      Appendix: Exclusions to the regulatory definition of ""information."" A table of examples such as affidavits, samples, direct observation, general solicitations, clinical examinations, general soliciations, public meetings, user accounts, commercial transactions, etc.

      __Can I provide compensation (gift, incentives) to respondents?__

      Yes but only in exceptional cases. Incentives should only be considered in the context of a rigorously designed and professionally implemented survey. They may not be used to offset the effects of poor questionnaires, inadequate follow-up or other deficiencies that unnecessarily compromise respondent cooperation.

      Compensation is not uncommon for focus group participants, but should rarely be used for other types of surveys. Any compensation given to respondents must be well justified within the justification document.

      __Brief Guidelines for Nonspecific/Nondirective Questions__

      Asking questions in a nonspecific/nondirective way may mean that you won’t always get exactly what you’re looking for, and won’t let you aggregate responses for statistical purposes. That’s the whole point: if you need comparable responses, then you need an ICR.

      The following table lists commonly used types of online solicitations and whether or not the PRA applies to them. For more information, consult OMB's Guidance on Social Media.

      __Asking Non-“Identical” questions the right way__

      OMB does not consider the following to be “identical”: Nonspecific or nondirective questions   such as those that ask for “facts or opinions” that the respondent wishes to provide on a specific topic without further specification of the information being sought or the form that a response should take.

      For example, a nondirective request for a respondent’s experience with a Federal program or a request for comment on a published report would appear to be so general as not to be “identical.” Such nondirective questions ask respondents to choose the information to be provided or recorded, and each respondent may choose to interpret the collection of information differently.

      A general solicitation (as described in the previous section) may pose a series of specific questions designed to elicit relevant public feedback; but the solicitation may not be a survey and the responses should be unstructured. Surveys of any kind, including web polls and satisfaction surveys that pose identical, specific questions (including through pop-up windows) are subject to the PRA.

      Nonstandardized oral inquiries--i.e., inquiries that do not follow a plan used to obtain “identical” information from ten or more persons--are also not considered to be “identical.”

    title: 4b. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)
    url_path: 4b-the-paperwork-reduction-act-pra
    body1: |
      ##What is the PRA?

      The Paperwork Reduction Act was intended to reduce the burden on the public from unnecessary, poorly designed and duplicative requests for information from the federal government. This is achieved by requiring an agency to get OMB approval (via an Information Collection Request) before collecting similar information from 10 or more non-federal persons or entities.
      This law applies even to small, simple & voluntary information collections, such as a conference or website survey. In response to the impracticality of creating an ICR for such collections, a ""generic ICR"" was created, which pre-approves a class of similar, low-burden surveys and guarantees simplified and expedited OMB review for individual requests.
      Notwithstanding this approval of the overall collection, each individual survey must still be submitted to OMB. Once OMB receives the new survey request, they will have 5 business days to either approve the collection or flag a concern that needs to be addressed.

      __PRA Language for Preambles__

      The preamble for each of the Agency's proposed and final rules must contain a discussion of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Please use the template below to assist you in drafting this portion of the preamble.

      ##PRA Requirements

      __What is the 40 CFR part 9 Table?__

      It is a table with two columns; one column for the 40 CFR regulatory citations of information collection requirements and the other for the OMB control number. The tables can be found at the end of every volume of title 40 of the CFR.

      __Why is this table important?__

      EPA enforcement attorneys, administrative law judges, and the public use 40 CFR part 9 to determine if a regulatory recordkeeping, reporting, or other regulatory information collection requirement has an OMB control number.

      __What do I need to do?__

      When OMB approves an ICR after a final rule is published in the Federal Register (FR), prepare and send the following documents to the ICR team along with the final rule ICR package:
      A draft FR document for a 40 CFR part 9 Technical Amendment.
      A separate FR Typesetting Request Form to pay for publishing the amendment in the FR.
      When OMB approves an ICR before a final rule is published in the FR (uncommon):
      Display the OMB control number in the preamble for the rule published in the FR and
      Include an amendment for 40 CFR part 9 as part of the rule in order to add to or revise the list of OMB control numbers or CFR citations (see regulatory text section of attachment)

      Collection Request (ICR) is a set of documents that describe reporting, record
      keeping, survey, or other information collection requirements imposed on the
      public by the Environmental Protection Agency.  A new information collection
      may be a survey, interview, focus group, form, or anything else that would ask
      the public to report or record information. Each request must be sent to and
      approved by the Office of Management and Budget before a collection begins.
      The ICR provides an overview of the collection, and estimates the cost and time
      for the public to respond. The public may view an ICR and submit comments on
      the ICR at any time. \n\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act stipulates that every federal
      agency must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before
      collecting the same or similar information from 10 or more members of the public.
      If EPA decides to gather such information, the appropriate program office must
      prepare an Information Collection Request (ICR) and submit it to the appropriate
      OCI Desk Officer. \n\nAfter reviewing the ICR, OMB may approve or disapprove
      the ICR. Alternatively, OMB may create conditions that must be met before the
      ICR is approved. This process was designed to prevent unnecessary collections
      and reduce costs.  \n\n__What happens if EPA does not obtain OMB approval for
      an information collection?__\n\nExamples of information collections include
      surveys, permit applications, questionnaires, standardized data collection,
      and reports. \n\n##What is covered in an ICR? \n\nAn Information Collection
      Request must include: \n\n- A description of the information to be collected
      \n\n- The reason the information is needed \n\n- An estimate of the time and
      cost for the public to answer the request. \n\n- See the Instruments page for
      more information (What does an ICR package contain?) \n\n##Is an ICR Necessary?
      \n\nAn ICR is required if the same or similar information is being collected
      from 10 or more non-Federal respondents within a 12-month period, even if the
      information collection is voluntary. Generally, any monitoring, reporting, or
      recordkeeping requirement imposed on non-Federal respondents by EPA will require
      an ICR. Surveys and questionnaires may also require an ICR. Additionally, information
      collections associated with all cooperative agreements and many grants require
      an ICR. When an ICR is required, it must be approved by OMB before the collection
      begins, regardless of whether the collection of information is mandatory, voluntary,
      or required to receive a benefit. \n\nTo assist you in determining whether an
      ICR is needed, review the __ICR decision tree__ for examples of when an ICR
      is needed. When deciding whether to renew an ICR, ask your program office if
      the information still needs to be collected. If the information will no longer
      be collected, do not renew the ICR. For additional guidance, consult your __OEI
      Desk Officer__. \n\n__When do Cooperative Agreements and Grants Need an ICR?__
      \n\nThe process and time required to develop an ICR and get approval from OMB
      depends on whether the ICR is an __initial__ or __renewal ICR__. Timing for
      initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent on the timing of the
      rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or final stage. Development
      of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at least 6 months. The timelines
      and quick guides below provide more information specific to each type of ICR.
      \n\n[ICR request and approval process](insert media) \n\n##Exemptions \n\nEPA
      has promulgated a rule that provides the regulated community with the possibility
      of exemption from a regulation. In order to receive the exemption, the facility
      must submit a letter requesting the exemption, with the appropriate supporting
      documentation, to the Regional Administrator. \n\nAn ICR is required for the
      exemption requirement. EPA generally requests ICR approval from OMB when a rule
      is promulgated (as part of the regulation development process). Neither the
      purpose of the collection nor the voluntary manner of a submission is relevant
      to the need for an ICR. An ICR is required for an exemption or waiver. EPA requires
      a contractor to develop a questionnaire on waste types and quantities. The contractor
      is not directed to do any further work. \n\n##Examples of When an ICR is Required
      \n\n- The contractor may develop a questionnaire without prior ICR approval.
      However, if EPA plans to send the questionnaire to 10 or more companies an ICR
      is needed. \n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor needs to request and use data
      from a report or booklet developed by an organization containing information
      collected from its industry. The organization produced the report or booklet
      for its own purposes. Because EPA did not direct or participate in the collection
      of the information, and because the request is directed to a single organization
      only, an ICR is not necessary. However, the source of the information should
      be noted in any document produced. \n\n*Note: If EPA develops the questions
      for the collection, sponsors the collection (e.g., via a cooperative agreement),
      or collects the information, an ICR is required. *\n\n- EPA approaches a trade
      association and requests that the association poll its membership for input
      concerning an EPA project. The total number of respondents is greater than ten.
      \n\n- Even though the trade association is collecting the information, an ICR
      is required because comments are in fact solicited by EPA from 10 or more respondents.
      \n\n- EPA approaches a trade association and requests comments, input or other
      information pertaining to an EPA project. The trade association provides the
      information to EPA from data in its existing files. \n\n- An ICR is not required
      because the association obtained the information from its existing files and
      did not conduct a poll or survey to obtain the information. If EPA asked the
      association to perform a poll or survey, then an ICR would be required. \n\n-
      EPA plans to promulgate a regulation that requires public notification of a
      public water system's failure to meet applicable national drinking water standards.
      The regulation will list various mechanisms for providing public notification
      such as newspaper notices, mailing notices, or submitting a press release to
      TV and/or radio stations. \n\n- An ICR is required because the EPA regulation
      requires disclosure of information to parties other than the Federal government
      which falls under the PRA third-party disclosure provision. \n\n---\n\n##Other

      body1: "##On This Page\n\n---\n\n##10+ Recipients\n\nAnytime a federal agency
        wants to collect similar information from 10 or more members of the public,
        the Paperwork Reduction Act requires that the agency first obtain OMB approval
        for the new collection. A new information collection may be a survey, interview,
        focus group, form, or anything else that would ask the public to report or
        record information. Learn more about new, non-rule related ICRs.\n\n__Are
        you requesting \"substantially similar\" information or posing identical questions
        to 10 or more respondents?__\n\nRequesting 10 or more respondents to provide
        the same level of information on the same subject would be considered as asking
        identical questions under the PRA and requires an ICR. For example: \n\n-
        An EPA employee or contractor needs to request information on solid waste
        regulations from 10 or more States. The employee or contractor intends to
        call each State to get clarification of the regulations and ask each State
        to assemble and provide additional new information on the implementation of
        the regulations.\n\n- An EPA employee and a contractor need to attend a trade
        association meeting of 10 or more industry representatives to discuss EPA
        and industry perspectives on general issues concerning special waste generation
        and management.\n\nGeneral observations and participation in general discussions
        do not require an ICR. The EPA employee or contractor must NOT use a list
        of standardized questions or ask the respondents to reply to identical questions
        during the meeting.\n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor needs to develop
        a list of questions on hazardous waste generation and management in preparation
        for a meeting with 10 or more representatives of different non-federal organizations.
        The employee or contractor then obtains answers to the questions from each
        of the representatives either at the meeting or as a follow-up.\n\nAn ICR
        is required. This goes beyond having a general discussion and would entail
        collecting substantially similar information from 10 or more non-federal respondents.\n\n-
        An EPA employee or a contractor needs to collect information from 7 separate
        State agencies and 4 Counties. The State agencies will be requested to provide
        information on discrete aspects of their municipal waste management regulatory
        authorities. The information requested from Counties will focus on different
        aspects of their recycling programs.\n\nAn ICR will not be required for this
        project if the information collected from the two groups is substantially
        different and there is no substantial overlap.\n\n##Public Audiences\n\nAll
        Cooperative Agreements that collect information from the public (including
        state, local, and tribal governments) must have an OMB approved ICR.\n\nGrants
        may or may not need an ICR. A grant needs an ICR if EPA directs the collection
        of information in any way. An example might be if EPA gives a grant and instructs
        the recipient to do a survey. A grant may not need an ICR if EPA is simply
        giving a grant to an institution and not directing the work in any way. Not
        sure if the EPA is sponsoring a grantee's collection? Give your __OEI Desk
        Officer__ a call.\n\n##General Applicability\n- An EPA employee or a contractor
        needs to obtain copies of existing solid waste regulations from 10 or more
        States\n\n- An ICR is not required for an information collection that is considered
        a customary business practice.\n\n- Providing EPA with a copy of material
        in its existing format, which is generally made available upon request (in
        this instance, the regulations), requires no new intellectual effort or burden
        and would fall under the category of customary business practice.\n\n- Any
        burden for preparing, keeping, or reporting information is exempt from further
        burden and cost analysis if the information is already prepared, kept, or
        reported as part of usual or customary business practice. If it is determined
        that your request is a Customary Business Practice, no ICR would be needed.\n\n-
        An EPA employee or a contractor needs to gather information on certain products,
        such as how they are packaged and what types of wastes are produced in the
        manufacture of these products and after product use. The company has brochures
        and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on these products and a report on a
        waste survey of its members. This material is available to the public upon
        request.\n\n- An ICR is not needed for product brochures, MSDS sheets or the
        survey results provided in existing formats. An ICR would be needed to collect
        new data on the types and quantities of wastes or packaging data or for re-assembling
        existing data in a new format.\n\n##Market Sector\n##American (y/n) \n##Customary

        ##Social Media Exceptions

        __Background__

        The PRA was created to protect the public from burdensome, unnecessary, low-utility or duplicative Federal requests for information. While the PRA never envisioned how government would use technological developments such as social media, these decidedly non-paperwork-related technologies are nonetheless subject to the provisions of the Act, which applies “regardless of form or format.”

        Prior approval must be obtained from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before EPA can ask for most types of information from the public. Approval is obtained through submission of an Information Collection Request (ICR), which is generally a substantial undertaking that requires 6-9 months on average to complete.

        However, not all public responses to agency solicitations constitute “information collections” depending on their format and use. Many (though not all) uses of social media fall outside the scope of the PRA, as outlined below. These same guidelines may also be applied to questions asked in traditional off-line formats, which may be structured so as to avoid the need for an ICR.

        ICRs are required whenever identical or substantially similar information is gathered by or for EPA from 10 or more non-Federal entities, regardless of whether a collection is voluntary or mandatory. As social media uses are open to large numbers of people, ICRs can only be avoided if either of the following are true: The solicitation does not seek “identical” information, or qualify as “information” (per OMB’s definition).

        __Tips for Avoiding an ICR__

          - Do Not Request “Information”
        OMB has specifically stated that submissions made via many social media platforms do not quality as "information" because they fall under longstanding exemptions for:

           - General Solicitations. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(4) excludes "facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations of comments from the public, published in the Federal Register or other publications, regardless of the form or format thereof, provided that no person is required to supply specific information pertaining to the commenter, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a condition of the agency’s full consideration of the comment."
         - Public Meetings. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(8) excludes certain "facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with public hearings or meetings."
        Like Items. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(10) reserves general authority for OMB to identify other "like items" that are not "information."
         - __OMB's Guidance on Social Media memo__ provides greater detail, but in brief, public comments or submissions made via the following social media platforms generally fall under the exemptions above and DO NOT require an ICR (within the stated limitations).

        OMB defines as “identical” those questions for which each respondent or group of respondents (e.g., in a focus group) is being asked to provide the same level of information on the same subject. Identical questions need not be phrased exactly the same way each time they are asked, nor does each respondent need to be asked the same “set of questions.” For this reason, we often characterize “identical” as meaning “substantially similar”.

        The following “creative” attempts to circumvent this definition are not valid and require an ICR:

        Rephrasing questions for different respondents.
        Breaking up a list of questions among 10 or more respondents so that each question is only asked of 9 or fewer respondents.
        Enlisting surrogates (such as Regions, States, Contractors or Grantees) to each gather the information from 9 or fewer people. (e.g. even if 10 Regions each ask 5 people the same question, it counts as 50 respondents).

        __How can I collect information without having to do an ICR?__

        The Social Media Guide provides some creative ways to collect information without triggering the need for an ICR.

        The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that any federal agency collecting similar information from 10 or more members of the public will require an OMB approved ICR. So, one way you can collect that information is by contacting fewer than 10 respondents. Another option available is to hold a public meeting where you can ask for general solicitation."
        "How to Ask Questions and Use Social Media Without Triggering an Information Collection Request (Word)
        “The PRA defines and uses ‘collection of information’ very broadly  to mean ‘the obtaining, causing to be obtained, solicitation or requiring the disclosure to third parties or the public’ of facts of opinions ‘regardless of the form or format’ used. ”Implementing Guidance for OMB Review of Agency Information Collection, June 2, 1999, Discussion of what is not considered “information” is contained on pages 23-28.
        OMB Memorandum, “Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act” April 7, 2010
        Web-Based Interactive Technologies: Data Search Tools, Calculators, and the Paperwork Reduction Act (2014)
        Appendix: Exclusions to the regulatory definition of ""information."" A table of examples such as affidavits, samples, direct observation, general solicitations, clinical examinations, general soliciations, public meetings, user accounts, commercial transactions, etc.

        __Can I provide compensation (gift, incentives) to respondents?__

        Yes but only in exceptional cases. Incentives should only be considered in the context of a rigorously designed and professionally implemented survey. They may not be used to offset the effects of poor questionnaires, inadequate follow-up or other deficiencies that unnecessarily compromise respondent cooperation.

        Compensation is not uncommon for focus group participants, but should rarely be used for other types of surveys. Any compensation given to respondents must be well justified within the justification document.

        __Brief Guidelines for Nonspecific/Nondirective Questions__

        Asking questions in a nonspecific/nondirective way may mean that you won’t always get exactly what you’re looking for, and won’t let you aggregate responses for statistical purposes. That’s the whole point: if you need comparable responses, then you need an ICR.

        The following table lists commonly used types of online solicitations and whether or not the PRA applies to them. For more information, consult OMB's Guidance on Social Media.

        __Asking Non-“Identical” questions the right way__

        OMB does not consider the following to be “identical”: Nonspecific or nondirective questions   such as those that ask for “facts or opinions” that the respondent wishes to provide on a specific topic without further specification of the information being sought or the form that a response should take.

        For example, a nondirective request for a respondent’s experience with a Federal program or a request for comment on a published report would appear to be so general as not to be “identical.” Such nondirective questions ask respondents to choose the information to be provided or recorded, and each respondent may choose to interpret the collection of information differently.

        A general solicitation (as described in the previous section) may pose a series of specific questions designed to elicit relevant public feedback; but the solicitation may not be a survey and the responses should be unstructured. Surveys of any kind, including web polls and satisfaction surveys that pose identical, specific questions (including through pop-up windows) are subject to the PRA.

        Nonstandardized oral inquiries--i.e., inquiries that do not follow a plan used to obtain “identical” information from ten or more persons--are also not considered to be “identical.”

      ICR Necessary?\nExemptions\nExamples of When an ICR is Required\n\n##What is
      an ICR?\nAn Information Collection Request (ICR) is a set of documents that
      describe reporting, record keeping, survey, or other information collection
      requirements imposed on the public by the Environmental Protection Agency.  A
      new information collection may be a survey, interview, focus group, form, or
      anything else that would ask the public to report or record information. Each
      request must be sent to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget
      before a collection begins. The ICR provides an overview of the collection,
      and estimates the cost and time for the public to respond. The public may view
      an ICR and submit comments on the ICR at any time.\n\nThe Paperwork Reduction
      Act stipulates that every federal agency must obtain approval from the Office
      of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting the same or similar information
      from 10 or more members of the public. If EPA decides to gather such information,
      the appropriate program office must prepare an Information Collection Request
      (ICR) and submit it to the appropriate OCI Desk Officer.\n\nAfter reviewing
      the ICR, OMB may approve or disapprove the ICR. Alternatively, OMB may create
      conditions that must be met before the ICR is approved. This process was designed
      to prevent unnecessary collections and reduce costs. \n\nExamples of information
      collections include surveys, permit applications, questionnaires, standardized
      data collection, and reports.\n\n##What is covered in an ICR?\nAn Information
      Collection Request must include:\n* A description of the information to be collected\n*
      The reason the information is needed\n* An estimate of the time and cost for
      the public to answer the request.\n\nSee the Instruments page for more information
      (What does an ICR package contain?)\n\n##Is an ICR Necessary?\nAn ICR is required
      if the same or similar information is being collected from 10 or more non\\-Federal
      respondents within a 12-month period, even if the information collection is
      voluntary. Generally, any monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirement
      imposed on non-Federal respondents by EPA will require an ICR. Surveys and questionnaires
      may also require an ICR. Additionally, information collections associated with
      all cooperative agreements and many grants require an ICR. When an ICR is required,
      it must be approved by OMB before the collection begins, regardless of whether
      the collection of information is mandatory, voluntary, or required to receive
      a benefit.\nTo assist you in determining whether an ICR is needed, review the
      ICR decision tree for examples of when an ICR is needed. When deciding whether
      to renew an ICR, ask your program office if the information still needs to be
      collected. If the information will no longer be collected, do not renew the
      ICR. For additional guidance, consult your OEI Desk Officer.\n\n###When do Cooperative
      Agreements and Grants Need an ICR?\nThe process and time required to develop
      an ICR and get approval from OMB depends on whether the ICR is an initial or
      renewal ICR. Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent
      on the timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or
      final stage. Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at
      least 6 months. The timelines and quick guides below provide more information
      specific to each type of ICR.\n• ICR request and approval process\n\n###Exemptions\nEPA
      has promulgated a rule that provides the regulated community with the possibility
      of exemption from a regulation. In order to receive the exemption, the facility
      must submit a letter requesting the exemption, with the appropriate supporting
      documentation, to the Regional Administrator.\n\nAn ICR is required for the
      exemption requirement. EPA generally requests ICR approval from OMB when a rule
      is promulgated (as part of the regulation development process). Neither the
      purpose of the collection nor the voluntary manner of a submission is relevant
      to the need for an ICR. An ICR is required for an exemption or waiver. EPA requires
      a contractor to develop a questionnaire on waste types and quantities. The contractor
      is not directed to do any further work. An EPA employee wants to send the questionnaire
      to 10 or more companies.\n##Examples of When an ICR is Required\nIs this a request

      is promulgated (as part of the regulation development process). Neither the
      purpose of the collection nor the voluntary manner of a submission is relevant
      to the need for an ICR. An ICR is required for an exemption or waiver.\n\n•\tEPA

      a questionnaire without prior ICR approval. However, if EPA plans to send the
      questionnaire to 10 or more companies an ICR is needed.\n\n•\tAn EPA employee
      or a contractor needs to request and use data from a report or booklet developed
      by an organization containing information collected from its industry. The organization
      produced the report or booklet for its own purposes.\no\tBecause EPA did not
      direct or participate in the collection of the information, and because the
      request is directed to a single organization only, an ICR is not necessary.
      However, the source of the information should be noted in any document produced.
      Note: If EPA develops the questions for the collection, sponsors the collection

      body1: "##Goals & Inventory\n\n##Requirements\n__What Does an ICR Package Contain?__\n\nThe
        items that are required in an ICR package will depend on whether the ICR is
        for a new rule-related collection, a new non-rule collection, or a renewal
        of an existing collection. New rule-related ICR packages will contain a Supporting
        Statement and ICRAS form. ICR packages for new non-rule related collections
        and renewals will require a Supporting Statement, first and second Federal
        Register notices, and ICRAS forms. In addition, there are some other issues
        you should consider to ensure your collection conforms with other EPA standards
        and guidelines.\n\nPreparing an ICR package usually takes several months.
        It can include developing or updating a Supporting Statement, gathering public
        comments through the publication of a Federal Register notice, and completing
        ICRAS forms. The process can be time-consuming, often taking at least 6 months
        in the case of new non-rule and renewal ICRs. New rule ICRs can be somewhat
        less time-consuming. However, early preparation is the key to ensuring the
        ICR process does not hinder the timely collection of data.\n\nSee the following
        materials for more information.\n\n__Supporting Statement__:\n- To satisfy
        the requirements of the PRA and OMB's regulations, the Supporting Statement
        must clearly establish the need for and the use of the information, the advantages
        of the collection method(s) selected over alternative methods, and the estimated
        costs (both costs associated with the burden hours and capital costs) imposed
        on both respondents and Agency personnel by the collection.\n\n__ICRAS Forms__:\n-
        The Information Collections Request and Approval System (ICRAS), OEI’s online
        submission system, requires a summary of the detailed burden calculations
        contained in the Supporting Statement. The ICRAS template will help you gather
        the information required to be entered into ICRAS. Please be sure to read
        the instructions before completing both parts of the template. For additional
        information on using ICRAS or visit www.paperworkreduction.gov, contact your
        OEI Desk Officer.\n\n__Federal Register Notices__:\n- Federal Register notices
        are used to solicit public comments and are required as part of the ICR package.
        For new non-rule and renewal ICRs, the program must prepare and publish a
        first Federal Register notice, soliciting public comments for 60 days. The
        Supporting Statement should contain a summary of the comments received and
        the actions taken in response to those comments. The program is also responsible
        for drafting a second Federal Register notice, which must be included in the
        ICR package submitted to OEI. OEI will publish the second FR notice once OEI’s
        review of the ICR package is complete. For rule-related ICRs, the Federal
        Register notice is published as part of the rule-making process.\n\n__How
        do I submit an ICR package to OEI for review and submission to OMB?__\n\n##Forms\n\nIf
        respondents must fill out a form, questionnaire, survey, or other written
        collection of information as part of your ICR, you must submit a copy of the
        form along with your ICR package.\n\nTo initiate the process of developing
        an external public use form or revising an existing form, form owners should
        contact the External Public Use Forms Officer well in advance of the time
        that the form needs to be used. Guidance will be provided as well as a form
        number (if it is a new form) once a completed Form Action Request has been
        received by the __External Public Use Forms Officer__. The form owner must
        develop and/or update the form in accordance with the __Forms Design Specifications__.
        It must adhere to the Design Specifications, including correct use of the
        EPA logo, and must display the EPA Form Number, OMB Control Number, and burden
        statement. Once the form is complete, it is submitted as part of the ICR package
        for review prior to submission to OMB.  Forms may not be used or distributed
        until OMB approval is received.\n\nTo obtain more information, you can visit
        the [FormSmart website](http://intranet.epa.gov/forms), or send an e-mail
        to externalforms@epa.gov.\n\nYou can also obtain information directly from
        your __Program Office's Forms Liaison__.\n\n##Submission Worksheet\n__Why
        Fill it Out?__\nThe information requested in the worksheet mirrors the information
        that OMB requires with all ICR submissions. Your ICR Desk Officer will transfer
        the data in the worksheet into OMB's ICR submission system.\n\n__ICR Template__\nThe
        __ICR Submission Worksheet__ gets included with the ICR package that is submitted
        to OEI. Please fill out the boxes in the worksheet so that your Desk Officer
        will able to submit the ICR package to OMB.\n__Learn more.__\n\n__ICRAS__\nOnce
        the ICR package has been compiled, you will need to submit it to your __OEI
        Desk Officer__. All ICRs must be submitted to OEI through the Information
        Collection Request and Approval System (ICRAS), EPA's on-line ICR submission
        system. Before submitting the ICR package to OEI, you should review the following
        checklist to make sure everything is in order. Once the ICR is submitted to
        OEI, your OEI desk officer will review it before submitting the ICR to OMB
        for approval.\n\n##Help and Contacts\n__Who approves an ICR?__\nEach request
        must be sent to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget before
        a collection begins. The ICR provides an overview of the collection, and estimates
        the cost and time for the public to respond. The public may view an ICR and
        submit comments on the ICR at any time.\n\n##508\n\n##Records\n\n##Privacy

        ##1st Notice

        The 1st Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with an ICR's data and published in the Federal Register. The notice is posted for 60 days.

        ##2nd Notice

        The 2nd Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with the ICR's data and then is submitted to OEI for publishing. This notice is posted for 30 days. Learn more.

        ##FR Process for New ICR

        For a new ICR that is not part of a rulemaking, follow the same process as the renewal ICRs.

        ##FR Process for Proposed Rule

        For proposed rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list any new information collection requirements. Proposed rules with new information collections follow Template A of the rule preamble guidance.

        ##FR Process for Final Rule

        For final rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list the EPA ICR number as well as the assigned OMB control number. Final Rules may follow either one of the templates in the rule preamble guidance.

        ##FR Process for Renewals

        Nine months prior to an ICR's expiration date, programs should begin working on their renewal packages.
        - Start going over the previous collection by talking with a few respondents to get a feel for the current levels of burden estimates.
        - Begin adjusting the burden hours, responses, and salary costs in the supporting statement to current levels.
        - Draft the 1st FR Notice with the ICR's current data.
        - Submit the 1st FR Notice and Typesetting Request Form to the FR Office (contacts listed on right, or send them an e-mail).
        - 1st FR Notice should publish 6 months prior to ICR's expiration date.
        - After the 1st FR Notice publishes, finalize the renewal package by completing the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.

        ##General FAQ

        __Why do I need to contact the Federal Register Office?__
        For a renewal of an Information Collection Request, program offices publish the 1st Federal Register Notice at least 6 months prior to the ICR's expiration date. The current templates are available on the Federal Register Notices page. For the 2nd Federal Register notice, program offices complete the notice and email it, along with the rest of their ICR package, to their ICR Desk Officer. For ICR renewals, this step would take place between 3 and 4 months prior to the ICR's expiration date.

        __How do I publish a Federal Register Notice?__
        For the 1st Federal Register Notice, fill out the 1st FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Then, submit the 1st FR Notice, a Typesetting Request, and an Action Information Sheet to the Office of Policy s, Office of the Federal Register (OFR). See their Federal Register Publishing intranet site for more details, templates, and contact information.
        For the 2nd Federal Register Notice, fill out the 2nd FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.

      type of ICR. \n\nSee ICR Information Forms for an example of the information
      to prepare for the ICR Process. This information is required to change, reinstate,

      Contain? \n\nThe items that are required in an ICR package will depend on whether
      the ICR is for a new rule-related collection, a new non-rule collection, or
      a renewal of an existing collection (New Rule vs. New Non-Rule and Renewal ICRs).
      New rule-related ICR packages will contain a Supporting Statement and ICRAS
      form. ICR packages for new non-rule related collections and renewals will require
      a Supporting Statement, first and second Federal Register notices, and ICRAS
      forms. In addition, there are some other issues you should consider to ensure
      your collection conforms with other EPA standards and guidelines. Preparing
      an ICR package usually takes several months. It can include developing or updating
      a Supporting Statement, gathering public comments through the publication of
      a Federal Register notice, and completing ICRAS forms. The process can be time-consuming,
      often taking at least 6 months in the case of new non-rule and renewal ICRs.
      New rule ICRs can be somewhat less time-consuming. However, early preparation
      is the key to ensuring the ICR process does not hinder the timely collection
      of data. \n\nSee the following materials for more information. \n\nSupporting
      Statement: \n\nTo satisfy the requirements of the PRA and OMB's regulations,
      the Supporting Statement must clearly establish the need for and the use of
      the information, the advantages of the collection method(s) selected over alternative
      methods, and the estimated costs (both costs associated with the burden hours
      and capital costs) imposed on both respondents and Agency personnel by the collection.
      \n\nICRAS/ROCIS: \n\nThe Information Collections Request and Approval System
      (ICRAS), OEI’s online submission system, requires a summary of the detailed
      burden calculations contained in the Supporting Statement. The ICRAS template
      will help you gather the information required to be entered into ICRAS. Please
      be sure to read the instructions before completing both parts of the template.
      For additional information on using ICRAS or visit www.paperworkreduction.gov,
      contact your OEI Desk Officer. \n\nFederal Register Notices: \n\nFederal Register

      notice, which must be included in the ICR package submitted to OEI. OEI will
      publish the second FR notice once OEI’s review of the ICR package is complete.

        where information costs are a significant fraction of the total regulatory
        or compliance costs. The analyst preparing the ICR, and his or her counterpart
        working on the EA, should have in mind the same program model and cost elements.
        The costs associated with creating, collecting, maintaining, and reporting
        information are a subset of the entire cost of the regulation.\n"

        expediency required in approving and forwarding it to the Government Printing
        Office for publication. Note: In addition to the those listed in their template,
        OP has indicated that they would like to see a section noting whether (or
        how many) comments were received on the first notice and how (generally) the
        program office has responded to them in their final ICR submission.*\n\n__How
        to Find Existing Collection__\n__1st Notice__\n__2nd Notice__\n__New SS Format__\n__New
        Forms Requirements__\n__Additional Considerations when Developing or Renewing
        an ICR__\n\nEPA, like all other Federal agencies, is rapidly moving into the
        electronic information age. The increased use of information technology is
        quickly becoming a part of how EPA does business. EPA is committed to meeting
        the changing demands of a technology-centered society and has developed new
        standards and tools to improve the efficiency and quality of its information.
        As new collections are planned and existing ones renewed through the ICR process,
        it is important to ensure that all new requirements are met.\n\nTo learn more
        about EPA data standards, quality considerations, and other requirements you
        should be aware of, see the following information.\n\n##New Non-Rulemaking\n\nAn
        initial (new) ICR may be either rule-related or non-rule-related. A rule-related
        ICR corresponds to the promulgation of a regulation that requires the collection
        of information. A non-rule ICR usually refers to a survey or a voluntary program,
        such as EPA's Energy Star programs, that is not associated with a specific
        rulemaking.\n\nAn initial ICR is an ICR that is being submitted to OMB for
        the approval of a new collections. If EPA wishes to begin a new collection
        of information, an ICR must be submitted to and approved by OMB before the
        collections of information may begin. An initial ICR must discuss projected
        benefits and costs, which are usually based an estimates and analogies to
        similar colections.\n\nA renewal ICR is an ICR that is being submitted to
        OMB for re-approval of an existing information collection. OMB approval of
        an ICR is granted for a maximum of three years, so EPA must renew any ICR
        for which continued compliance is required. If EPA wishes to continue collecting
        the information past the three year approval, an ICR renewal package must
        be submitted to OMB for approval prior to the current expiration date. A renewal
        ICR must discuss the differences between original expectations, as embodied
        in the new ICR, and actual collection experiences and results. The renewal
        must also respond to any Terms of Clearance issued by OMB in the previous
        approval. The renewal process is the same for both rule-related and non-rule
        ICRs.\n\n##New Rulemaking\n\n__Proposed ICRs__\nA Proposed Rule ICR is an
        ICR that is associated with new regulations. Not all rules have new information
        collections, but many do. Any time there is a new rule where EPA will collect
        new information from the public, the agency will need to submit the accompanying
        ICR to OMB. A Final Rule ICR will need to be submitted to OMB for approval
        before the rule becomes effective. Learn more.\n\nTiming and process for initial
        rule-related ICRs\n The process and time required to develop an ICR and get
        approval from OMB depends on whether the ICR is an initial or renewal ICR.
        Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related is largely dependent on the
        timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is in the proposed or final
        stage. Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically takes at least
        6 months. The timelines and quick guides below provide more information specific
        to each type of ICR.\n\n__Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)__\nA Notice
        of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), also known as a Proposed Rule, is an announcement
        of proposed new regulations or modifications to existing regulations that
        is published in the Federal Register. An NRPM seeks public comments on the
        proposed rulemaking. For proposed rules, an ICR package containing the Supporting
        Statement and completed ICRAS forms must be submitted to your OEI Desk Officer
        at least one month prior to the proposed rule being published in the Federal
        Register. OEI will then submit the ICR to OMB on the day the proposed rule
        is published in the Federal Register.\n\nWhen an ICR is prepared for a NPRM,
        specific language is required in the preamble of the rule.\n\n__Steps to Create
        Proposed Rule ICR__\nWrite the supporting statement for the proposed rule.\nFill
        in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of the rule preamble.\nSend supporting
        statement and ICR Submission Worksheet to ICR Desk Officer for review at least
        1 month before it needs to go to OMB.\nAfter the Administrator signs the Proposed
        Rule, notify OEI of when it is expected to publish. This is so that OEI will
        be able to submit the ICR to OMB on the day that it publishes in the Federal
        Register.\nOne month in advance of the proposed rule publishing, add all documents
        including the supporting statement and any forms to the Federal Docket Management
        System, FDMS. For questions on FDMS, please contact the Docket Center.\nOMB
        reviews and files comments on Proposed Rule ICR.\nProgram office develops
        ICR for Final Rule and sends their ICR Desk Officer the package for review.\nSubmit
        the ICR to OMB. This step most commonly takes place on the day the final rule
        gets published.\n\n__Final Rule ICRs__\nA final rule sets out new or revised
        requirements and their effective date. A final rule also may remove requirements.
        When preceded by a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), a final rule will
        also identify significant substantive issues raised by commenters in response
        to the NPRM and will give the agency's response. Final rules are often codified
        in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nWhether an ICR package is required
        for the final rule depends on several factors.\n\nIf OMB pre-approves the
        ICR for the proposed rule and the final rule does not change information requirements,
        then an ICR is not necessary for the final rule. Instead the Program Office
        must submit an estimate of the burden hours and costs to OEI.\nIf OMB does
        not pre-approve the ICR for the proposed rule or information requirements
        have changed since the proposed rule, then an ICR is required.\nIf an ICR
        is required, an ICR package must be submitted to your OEI Desk Officer at
        least three months prior to the final rule being published in the Federal
        Register. This will allow the ICR package to be submitted OMB at the same
        time the final rule is sent for to OMB for review. The ICR will then already
        have been approved when the rule is promulgated and the 40 CFR Part 9 Table
        can be amended to include the OMB approval number.\n\nWhen an ICR is prepared
        for a final rule, specific language is required in the preamble of the rule.\n\n__Steps
        to Create Final Rule ICR__\nModify the supporting statement as needed.\nModify
        the preamble as needed.\nRule goes to OMB for review. After OMB finishes their
        review, make any modifications needed to the ICR and send the rule preamble,
        ICR Submission Worksheet, and supporting statement to your ICR Desk Officer
        for review. The Final Rule ICR package should be submitted to OEI for review
        at least 3 months before it needs to go to OMB.\nEPA needs to submit the Final
        Rule ICR to OMB 60 days before the effective date so that OMB has enough time
        to review the ICR. Typically OEI will submit the ICR to OMB on the day that
        the final rule publishes in the Federal Register. However, if the publishing
        date is less than 60 days until the effective date, then OEI will need to
        submit the ICR to OMB prior to publication.\n\n##Revision\n\nICRs are typically
        valid for 3 years. If a program would like to change anything that was in
        their OMB approved ICR, they may submit a revision package. Examples of when
        to revise an ICR:\n\n- Consolidate several ICRs into one\n- Change a form\n-
        Add a new form\n\n##New Collection Information Forms\n\n[insert links to the
        forms]\n\n##Generic ICR\n\n__What is the Generic ICR?__\nA tool to obtain
        expedited OMB clearance for low-burden customer service satisfaction surveys
        without the time and effort required to create a\n\"\"standard\"\" Information
        Collection Request.\n\nSatisfaction surveys have been cleared under this generic
        ICR for collections such as:\n\n- Conferences/Workshops\n- EPA Websites, Publications
        and Data Systems\n- Community/Industry Outreach and Education Programs\n-
        Help Desks and Processing Centers\n- Focus Groups\n\n__How can the Generic
        ICR help me?__\n- 5-day turnaround at OMB\n- No public notice and comment
        requirements\n- Simplified Supporting Statement\n- Quick processing and approval
        time\n\n__General Guidelines__\n\nEach question and the survey structure should
        be designed to elicit responses that are useful to improve products or services.
        \n- Is each question designed to gather information that you will be able
        to act upon?\n- Keep the survey short and simple, in recognition that a respondent's
        time is limited.\n- Most accurate responses require that questions are ordered
        to first focus on the product or service. After these types of questions are
        completed, an optional second set of questions could identify characteristics
        of the respondent.\n- Questions should be non-duplicative, both of other surveys
        that already exist and of questions within the same survey.\n- Scales should
        have a midpoint to allow for a neutral response, and also a N/A option.\n-
        Any demographic questions should be placed at the end of the survey.\n- Responses
        and data received should be used for internal purposes only and not aggregated
        to make external claims.\n- Both qualitative and quantitative questions may
        be asked, however, any statistical methods used must be explained in the justification.\n\n__What
        surveys are covered by the Generic ICR?__\nOnly those surveys which measure
        satisfaction with agency services qualify to use this ICR. In addition, the
        survey must meet the following requirements:\n\n- The collection is voluntary.\n-
        The collection is low-burden for respondents and low-cost for the Federal
        Government.\n- The collection is non-controversial and does not raise issues
        of concern to other federal agencies.\n- The results are not intended to be
        disseminated to the public.\nInformation gathered will not be used for the
        purpose of substantially informing influential policy decisions.\n- The collection
        is targeted to the solicitation of opinions from respondents who have experience
        with the program or may have experience with the program in the future.\n-
        Please note that questions whose goal is to seek to evaluate the effectiveness
        or impacts of a program rather than a customer's opinions or experience are
        not within the scope of the generic ICR.\n\n__Which formats can I use to collect
        the data?__\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act applies regardless of the medium
        used to collect information, as such the generic ICR can be used for surveys
        conducted by:\n- Internet, including social media platforms (ForSee, Google
        Forms, SurveyMonkey, Facebook, EPA website, email)\n- Telephone\n- In-person
        or on-site (conference & workshop evaluations, interviews, focus groups)\n-
        Mail (traditional surveys, comment cards)\n\nOther, may include:\n- Customer
        satisfaction surveys\n- Customer comment card/Complaint forms\n- Usability
        testing (website, software)\n- Focus groups\n- Small discussion groups\n\n__What
        types of questions can I ask?__\n- Yes/No\n- Directed Responses (drop-down
        menus, radio buttons, polls)\n- Ratings\n- Free response (text box)\n\n####Fast
        Track\n\n####Generic Customer Service Satisfaction Survey\n\n####Justification\n\nWhen
        creating a new generic customer service satisfaction survey, you will need
        to write up a justification explaining what information you are going to collect
        and how long it will take for the public to respond. Use the Justification
        Template to describe the survey. Learn more.\n\n####Approval\n\nNew generic
        survey requests should be e-mailed to an ICR Desk Officer in OEI.\n\nSteps
        in the process:\n\nReview the guidance and samples provided on this webpage.
        Contact an OEI Desk Officer if you have additional questions.\nEmail a completed
        Justification Template along with a copy of your survey questions to an OEI
        Desk Officer.\nOEI will review the package and, if necessary, reply with comments.\nOnce
        the package is completed to everyone s satisfaction, the OEI team will transmit
        the new generic request to OMB.\nOMB has 5 business days to review the package.
        By the end of that period, OMB will have either responded will questions or
        additional requests, rejected the collection, approved the collection, or
        not-responded at all -- in which case the generic collection is approved by
        default. If you do not hear from your OEI Desk Officer by the end of the 5
        business day review period, contact them to ascertain the status of your proposed
        generic collection.\n\n####Templates and Examples\n\n####Non-Fast Track\n\n####New

      url_path: 4b-the-paperwork-reduction-act-pra
      body1: |
        ##What is the PRA?

        The Paperwork Reduction Act was intended to reduce the burden on the public from unnecessary, poorly designed and duplicative requests for information from the federal government. This is achieved by requiring an agency to get OMB approval (via an Information Collection Request) before collecting similar information from 10 or more non-federal persons or entities.
        This law applies even to small, simple & voluntary information collections, such as a conference or website survey. In response to the impracticality of creating an ICR for such collections, a ""generic ICR"" was created, which pre-approves a class of similar, low-burden surveys and guarantees simplified and expedited OMB review for individual requests.
        Notwithstanding this approval of the overall collection, each individual survey must still be submitted to OMB. Once OMB receives the new survey request, they will have 5 business days to either approve the collection or flag a concern that needs to be addressed.

        __PRA Language for Preambles__

        The preamble for each of the Agency's proposed and final rules must contain a discussion of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Please use the template below to assist you in drafting this portion of the preamble.

        ##PRA Requirements

        __What is the 40 CFR part 9 Table?__

        It is a table with two columns; one column for the 40 CFR regulatory citations of information collection requirements and the other for the OMB control number. The tables can be found at the end of every volume of title 40 of the CFR.

        __Why is this table important?__

        EPA enforcement attorneys, administrative law judges, and the public use 40 CFR part 9 to determine if a regulatory recordkeeping, reporting, or other regulatory information collection requirement has an OMB control number.

        __What do I need to do?__

        When OMB approves an ICR after a final rule is published in the Federal Register (FR), prepare and send the following documents to the ICR team along with the final rule ICR package:
        A draft FR document for a 40 CFR part 9 Technical Amendment.
        A separate FR Typesetting Request Form to pay for publishing the amendment in the FR.
        When OMB approves an ICR before a final rule is published in the FR (uncommon):
        Display the OMB control number in the preamble for the rule published in the FR and
        Include an amendment for 40 CFR part 9 as part of the rule in order to add to or revise the list of OMB control numbers or CFR citations (see regulatory text section of attachment)

    ##ICR Owners or Points of Contact
    __EPA Program Office__

    EPA program offices develop Information Collection Requests (ICRs) and must ensure they have active ICRs, approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for all of their information collection activities.

    __Office of Environmental Information__
    The Office of Environmental Information tracks and reviews all ICRs and submits them to OMB. Each office in the Environmental Protection Agency has an assigned Desk Officer in OEI.

    __Office of Management and Budget__
    OMB reviews, comments on, and approves ICRs. Legally, a collection cannot begin without OMB approval.

    ##Form Liaisons

    If EPA decides to gather such information, the appropriate program office must prepare an Information Collection Request (ICR) and submit it to the appropriate ICR Desk Officer.

    that OMB approves an ICR for is three years. If the collection is going to continue,
    programs start to prepare their ICR renewal packages 9 months prior to its expiration
    date. __Learn more.__\n\n__What do I need to do in order to renew my ICR?__\n\n-
    Evaluate the supporting statement to determine collection needs in the future
    3 years.\n- Consult with fewer than 10 respondents for feedback on the ICR.\n-
    Evaluate the burden calculations and make adjustments. How many responses are
    expected in the next 3 years? What are the current salary rates from the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics?\n- Prepare the 1st Federal Register Notice using the current
    template.\n- Publish the 1st Federal Register Notice 6 months prior to expiration.
    This will allow for sufficient time to collect comments in preparation for the
    ICR submission to OMB.\n- Finalize the supporting statement, prepare the 2nd Federal
    Register notice, and complete the ICR Submission Worksheet.\n- E-mail the ICR
    Desk Officer with the completed ICR package that is ready to go to OMB.\nThe package
    should include:\n  - Supporting Statement\n  - 2nd Federal Register Notice\n  -
    ICR Submission Worksheet,\n  - Any applicable Forms, Surveys, or other documents
    that need to accompany the ICR.\n  - An Action Information Sheet  This will be
    forwarded to the Office of Policy (OP) along with the final Federal Register notice
    print request. \n\n  *The Action Information Sheet is used to help that OP understand
    the context and importance of the notice and gauge the level of expediency required
    in approving and forwarding it to the Government Printing Office for publication.
    Note: In addition to the those listed in their template, OP has indicated that
    they would like to see a section noting whether (or how many) comments were received
    on the first notice and how (generally) the program office has responded to them
    in their final ICR submission.*\n\n__How to Find Existing Collection__\n__1st
    Notice__\n__2nd Notice__\n__New SS Format__\n__New Forms Requirements__\n__Additional
    Considerations when Developing or Renewing an ICR__\n\nEPA, like all other Federal
    agencies, is rapidly moving into the electronic information age. The increased
    use of information technology is quickly becoming a part of how EPA does business.
    EPA is committed to meeting the changing demands of a technology-centered society
    and has developed new standards and tools to improve the efficiency and quality
    of its information. As new collections are planned and existing ones renewed through
    the ICR process, it is important to ensure that all new requirements are met.\n\nTo
    learn more about EPA data standards, quality considerations, and other requirements
    you should be aware of, see the following information.\n\n##New Non-Rulemaking\n\nAn
    initial (new) ICR may be either rule-related or non-rule-related. A rule-related
    ICR corresponds to the promulgation of a regulation that requires the collection
    of information. A non-rule ICR usually refers to a survey or a voluntary program,
    such as EPA's Energy Star programs, that is not associated with a specific rulemaking.\n\nAn
    initial ICR is an ICR that is being submitted to OMB for the approval of a new
    collections. If EPA wishes to begin a new collection of information, an ICR must
    be submitted to and approved by OMB before the collections of information may
    begin. An initial ICR must discuss projected benefits and costs, which are usually
    based an estimates and analogies to similar colections.\n\nA renewal ICR is an
    ICR that is being submitted to OMB for re-approval of an existing information
    collection. OMB approval of an ICR is granted for a maximum of three years, so
    EPA must renew any ICR for which continued compliance is required. If EPA wishes
    to continue collecting the information past the three year approval, an ICR renewal
    package must be submitted to OMB for approval prior to the current expiration
    date. A renewal ICR must discuss the differences between original expectations,
    as embodied in the new ICR, and actual collection experiences and results. The
    renewal must also respond to any Terms of Clearance issued by OMB in the previous
    approval. The renewal process is the same for both rule-related and non-rule ICRs.\n\n##New
    Rulemaking\n\n__Proposed ICRs__\nA Proposed Rule ICR is an ICR that is associated
    with new regulations. Not all rules have new information collections, but many
    do. Any time there is a new rule where EPA will collect new information from the
    public, the agency will need to submit the accompanying ICR to OMB. A Final Rule
    ICR will need to be submitted to OMB for approval before the rule becomes effective.
    Learn more.\n\nTiming and process for initial rule-related ICRs\n The process
    and time required to develop an ICR and get approval from OMB depends on whether
    the ICR is an initial or renewal ICR. Timing for initial ICRs that are rule-related
    is largely dependent on the timing of the rule-making and whether the rule is
    in the proposed or final stage. Development of new non-rule and renewal ICRs typically
    takes at least 6 months. The timelines and quick guides below provide more information
    specific to each type of ICR.\n\n__Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)__\nA Notice
    of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), also known as a Proposed Rule, is an announcement
    of proposed new regulations or modifications to existing regulations that is published
    in the Federal Register. An NRPM seeks public comments on the proposed rulemaking.
    For proposed rules, an ICR package containing the Supporting Statement and completed
    ICRAS forms must be submitted to your OEI Desk Officer at least one month prior
    to the proposed rule being published in the Federal Register. OEI will then submit
    the ICR to OMB on the day the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.\n\nWhen
    an ICR is prepared for a NPRM, specific language is required in the preamble of
    the rule.\n\n__Steps to Create Proposed Rule ICR__\nWrite the supporting statement
    for the proposed rule.\nFill in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of the rule
    preamble.\nSend supporting statement and ICR Submission Worksheet to ICR Desk
    Officer for review at least 1 month before it needs to go to OMB.\nAfter the Administrator
    signs the Proposed Rule, notify OEI of when it is expected to publish. This is
    so that OEI will be able to submit the ICR to OMB on the day that it publishes
    in the Federal Register.\nOne month in advance of the proposed rule publishing,
    add all documents including the supporting statement and any forms to the Federal
    Docket Management System, FDMS. For questions on FDMS, please contact the Docket
    Center.\nOMB reviews and files comments on Proposed Rule ICR.\nProgram office
    develops ICR for Final Rule and sends their ICR Desk Officer the package for review.\nSubmit
    the ICR to OMB. This step most commonly takes place on the day the final rule
    gets published.\n\n__Final Rule ICRs__\nA final rule sets out new or revised requirements
    and their effective date. A final rule also may remove requirements. When preceded
    by a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), a final rule will also identify significant
    substantive issues raised by commenters in response to the NPRM and will give
    the agency's response. Final rules are often codified in the Code of Federal Regulations
    (CFR).\n\nWhether an ICR package is required for the final rule depends on several
    factors.\n\nIf OMB pre-approves the ICR for the proposed rule and the final rule
    does not change information requirements, then an ICR is not necessary for the
    final rule. Instead the Program Office must submit an estimate of the burden hours
    and costs to OEI.\nIf OMB does not pre-approve the ICR for the proposed rule or
    information requirements have changed since the proposed rule, then an ICR is
    required.\nIf an ICR is required, an ICR package must be submitted to your OEI
    Desk Officer at least three months prior to the final rule being published in
    the Federal Register. This will allow the ICR package to be submitted OMB at the
    same time the final rule is sent for to OMB for review. The ICR will then already
    have been approved when the rule is promulgated and the 40 CFR Part 9 Table can
    be amended to include the OMB approval number.\n\nWhen an ICR is prepared for
    a final rule, specific language is required in the preamble of the rule.\n\n__Steps
    to Create Final Rule ICR__\nModify the supporting statement as needed.\nModify
    the preamble as needed.\nRule goes to OMB for review. After OMB finishes their
    review, make any modifications needed to the ICR and send the rule preamble, ICR
    Submission Worksheet, and supporting statement to your ICR Desk Officer for review.
    The Final Rule ICR package should be submitted to OEI for review at least 3 months
    before it needs to go to OMB.\nEPA needs to submit the Final Rule ICR to OMB 60
    days before the effective date so that OMB has enough time to review the ICR.
    Typically OEI will submit the ICR to OMB on the day that the final rule publishes
    in the Federal Register. However, if the publishing date is less than 60 days
    until the effective date, then OEI will need to submit the ICR to OMB prior to
    publication.\n\n##Revision\n\nICRs are typically valid for 3 years. If a program
    would like to change anything that was in their OMB approved ICR, they may submit
    a revision package. Examples of when to revise an ICR:\n\n- Consolidate several
    ICRs into one\n- Change a form\n- Add a new form\n\n##New Collection Information
    Forms\n\n[insert links to the forms]\n\n##Generic ICR\n\n__What is the Generic
    ICR?__\nA tool to obtain expedited OMB clearance for low-burden customer service
    satisfaction surveys without the time and effort required to create a\n\"\"standard\"\"
    Information Collection Request.\n\nSatisfaction surveys have been cleared under
    this generic ICR for collections such as:\n\n- Conferences/Workshops\n- EPA Websites,
    Publications and Data Systems\n- Community/Industry Outreach and Education Programs\n-
    Help Desks and Processing Centers\n- Focus Groups\n\n__How can the Generic ICR
    help me?__\n- 5-day turnaround at OMB\n- No public notice and comment requirements\n-
    Simplified Supporting Statement\n- Quick processing and approval time\n\n__General
    Guidelines__\n\nEach question and the survey structure should be designed to elicit
    responses that are useful to improve products or services. \n- Is each question
    designed to gather information that you will be able to act upon?\n- Keep the
    survey short and simple, in recognition that a respondent's time is limited.\n-
    Most accurate responses require that questions are ordered to first focus on the
    product or service. After these types of questions are completed, an optional
    second set of questions could identify characteristics of the respondent.\n- Questions
    should be non-duplicative, both of other surveys that already exist and of questions
    within the same survey.\n- Scales should have a midpoint to allow for a neutral
    response, and also a N/A option.\n- Any demographic questions should be placed
    at the end of the survey.\n- Responses and data received should be used for internal
    purposes only and not aggregated to make external claims.\n- Both qualitative
    and quantitative questions may be asked, however, any statistical methods used
    must be explained in the justification.\n\n__What surveys are covered by the Generic
    ICR?__\nOnly those surveys which measure satisfaction with agency services qualify
    to use this ICR. In addition, the survey must meet the following requirements:\n\n-
    The collection is voluntary.\n- The collection is low-burden for respondents and
    low-cost for the Federal Government.\n- The collection is non-controversial and
    does not raise issues of concern to other federal agencies.\n- The results are
    not intended to be disseminated to the public.\nInformation gathered will not
    be used for the purpose of substantially informing influential policy decisions.\n-
    The collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions from respondents who
    have experience with the program or may have experience with the program in the
    future.\n- Please note that questions whose goal is to seek to evaluate the effectiveness
    or impacts of a program rather than a customer's opinions or experience are not
    within the scope of the generic ICR.\n\n__Which formats can I use to collect the
    data?__\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act applies regardless of the medium used to
    collect information, as such the generic ICR can be used for surveys conducted
    by:\n- Internet, including social media platforms (ForSee, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey,
    Facebook, EPA website, email)\n- Telephone\n- In-person or on-site (conference
    & workshop evaluations, interviews, focus groups)\n- Mail (traditional surveys,
    comment cards)\n\nOther, may include:\n- Customer satisfaction surveys\n- Customer
    comment card/Complaint forms\n- Usability testing (website, software)\n- Focus
    groups\n- Small discussion groups\n\n__What types of questions can I ask?__\n-
    Yes/No\n- Directed Responses (drop-down menus, radio buttons, polls)\n- Ratings\n-
    Free response (text box)\n\n####Fast Track\n\n####Generic Customer Service Satisfaction
    Survey\n\n####Justification\n\nWhen creating a new generic customer service satisfaction
    survey, you will need to write up a justification explaining what information
    you are going to collect and how long it will take for the public to respond.
    Use the Justification Template to describe the survey. Learn more.\n\n####Approval\n\nNew
    generic survey requests should be e-mailed to an ICR Desk Officer in OEI.\n\nSteps
    in the process:\n\nReview the guidance and samples provided on this webpage. Contact
    an OEI Desk Officer if you have additional questions.\nEmail a completed Justification
    Template along with a copy of your survey questions to an OEI Desk Officer.\nOEI
    will review the package and, if necessary, reply with comments.\nOnce the package
    is completed to everyone s satisfaction, the OEI team will transmit the new generic
    request to OMB.\nOMB has 5 business days to review the package. By the end of
    that period, OMB will have either responded will questions or additional requests,
    rejected the collection, approved the collection, or not-responded at all -- in
    which case the generic collection is approved by default. If you do not hear from
    your OEI Desk Officer by the end of the 5 business day review period, contact
    them to ascertain the status of your proposed generic collection.\n\n####Templates

    an ICR package usually takes several months. It can include developing or updating
    a Supporting Statement, gathering public comments through the publication of a
    Federal Register notice, and completing ICRAS forms. The process can be time-consuming,
    often taking at least 6 months in the case of new non-rule and renewal ICRs. New
    rule ICRs can be somewhat less time-consuming. However, early preparation is the
    key to ensuring the ICR process does not hinder the timely collection of data.\n\nSee
    the following materials for more information.\n\n__Supporting Statement__:\n-
    To satisfy the requirements of the PRA and OMB's regulations, the Supporting Statement
    must clearly establish the need for and the use of the information, the advantages
    of the collection method(s) selected over alternative methods, and the estimated
    costs (both costs associated with the burden hours and capital costs) imposed
    on both respondents and Agency personnel by the collection.\n\n__ICRAS Forms__:\n-
    The Information Collections Request and Approval System (ICRAS), OEI’s online
    submission system, requires a summary of the detailed burden calculations contained
    in the Supporting Statement. The ICRAS template will help you gather the information
    required to be entered into ICRAS. Please be sure to read the instructions before
    completing both parts of the template. For additional information on using ICRAS
    or visit www.paperworkreduction.gov, contact your OEI Desk Officer.\n\n__Federal
    Register Notices__:\n- Federal Register notices are used to solicit public comments
    and are required as part of the ICR package. For new non-rule and renewal ICRs,
    the program must prepare and publish a first Federal Register notice, soliciting
    public comments for 60 days. The Supporting Statement should contain a summary
    of the comments received and the actions taken in response to those comments.
    The program is also responsible for drafting a second Federal Register notice,
    which must be included in the ICR package submitted to OEI. OEI will publish the
    second FR notice once OEI’s review of the ICR package is complete. For rule-related
    ICRs, the Federal Register notice is published as part of the rule-making process.\n\n__How
    do I submit an ICR package to OEI for review and submission to OMB?__\n\n##Forms\n\nIf
    respondents must fill out a form, questionnaire, survey, or other written collection
    of information as part of your ICR, you must submit a copy of the form along with
    your ICR package.\n\nTo initiate the process of developing an external public
    use form or revising an existing form, form owners should contact the External
    Public Use Forms Officer well in advance of the time that the form needs to be
    used. Guidance will be provided as well as a form number (if it is a new form)
    once a completed Form Action Request has been received by the __External Public
    Use Forms Officer__. The form owner must develop and/or update the form in accordance
    with the __Forms Design Specifications__. It must adhere to the Design Specifications,
    including correct use of the EPA logo, and must display the EPA Form Number, OMB
    Control Number, and burden statement. Once the form is complete, it is submitted
    as part of the ICR package for review prior to submission to OMB.  Forms may not
    be used or distributed until OMB approval is received.\n\nTo obtain more information,
    you can visit the [FormSmart website](http://intranet.epa.gov/forms), or send
    an e-mail to externalforms@epa.gov.\n\nYou can also obtain information directly
    from your __Program Office's Forms Liaison__.\n\n##Submission Worksheet\n__Why
    Fill it Out?__\nThe information requested in the worksheet mirrors the information
    that OMB requires with all ICR submissions. Your ICR Desk Officer will transfer
    the data in the worksheet into OMB's ICR submission system.\n\n__ICR Template__\nThe
    __ICR Submission Worksheet__ gets included with the ICR package that is submitted
    to OEI. Please fill out the boxes in the worksheet so that your Desk Officer will
    able to submit the ICR package to OMB.\n__Learn more.__\n\n__ICRAS__\nOnce the
    ICR package has been compiled, you will need to submit it to your __OEI Desk Officer__.
    All ICRs must be submitted to OEI through the Information Collection Request and
    Approval System (ICRAS), EPA's on-line ICR submission system. Before submitting
    the ICR package to OEI, you should review the following checklist to make sure
    everything is in order. Once the ICR is submitted to OEI, your OEI desk officer
    will review it before submitting the ICR to OMB for approval.\n\n##Help and Contacts\n__Who
    approves an ICR?__\nEach request must be sent to and approved by the Office of
    Management and Budget before a collection begins. The ICR provides an overview
    of the collection, and estimates the cost and time for the public to respond.
    The public may view an ICR and submit comments on the ICR at any time.\n\n##508\n\n##Records\n\n##Privacy

  url_path: 1a-recipient-and-audience-considerations
  body1: "##On This Page\n\n---\n\n##10+ Recipients\n\nAnytime a federal agency wants
    to collect similar information from 10 or more members of the public, the Paperwork
    Reduction Act requires that the agency first obtain OMB approval for the new collection.
    A new information collection may be a survey, interview, focus group, form, or
    anything else that would ask the public to report or record information. Learn
    more about new, non-rule related ICRs.\n\n__Are you requesting \"substantially
    similar\" information or posing identical questions to 10 or more respondents?__\n\nRequesting
    10 or more respondents to provide the same level of information on the same subject
    would be considered as asking identical questions under the PRA and requires an
    ICR. For example: \n\n- An EPA employee or contractor needs to request information
    on solid waste regulations from 10 or more States. The employee or contractor
    intends to call each State to get clarification of the regulations and ask each
    State to assemble and provide additional new information on the implementation
    of the regulations.\n\n- An EPA employee and a contractor need to attend a trade
    association meeting of 10 or more industry representatives to discuss EPA and
    industry perspectives on general issues concerning special waste generation and
    management.\n\nGeneral observations and participation in general discussions do
    not require an ICR. The EPA employee or contractor must NOT use a list of standardized
    questions or ask the respondents to reply to identical questions during the meeting.\n\n-
    An EPA employee or a contractor needs to develop a list of questions on hazardous
    waste generation and management in preparation for a meeting with 10 or more representatives
    of different non-federal organizations. The employee or contractor then obtains
    answers to the questions from each of the representatives either at the meeting
    or as a follow-up.\n\nAn ICR is required. This goes beyond having a general discussion
    and would entail collecting substantially similar information from 10 or more
    non-federal respondents.\n\n- An EPA employee or a contractor needs to collect
    information from 7 separate State agencies and 4 Counties. The State agencies
    will be requested to provide information on discrete aspects of their municipal
    waste management regulatory authorities. The information requested from Counties
    will focus on different aspects of their recycling programs.\n\nAn ICR will not
    be required for this project if the information collected from the two groups
    is substantially different and there is no substantial overlap.\n\n##Public Audiences\n\nAll
    Cooperative Agreements that collect information from the public (including state,
    local, and tribal governments) must have an OMB approved ICR.\n\nGrants may or
    may not need an ICR. A grant needs an ICR if EPA directs the collection of information
    in any way. An example might be if EPA gives a grant and instructs the recipient
    to do a survey. A grant may not need an ICR if EPA is simply giving a grant to
    an institution and not directing the work in any way. Not sure if the EPA is sponsoring
    a grantee's collection? Give your __OEI Desk Officer__ a call.\n\n##General Applicability\n-
    An EPA employee or a contractor needs to obtain copies of existing solid waste
    regulations from 10 or more States\n\n- An ICR is not required for an information
    collection that is considered a customary business practice.\n\n- Providing EPA
    with a copy of material in its existing format, which is generally made available
    upon request (in this instance, the regulations), requires no new intellectual
    effort or burden and would fall under the category of customary business practice.\n\n-
    Any burden for preparing, keeping, or reporting information is exempt from further
    burden and cost analysis if the information is already prepared, kept, or reported
    as part of usual or customary business practice. If it is determined that your
    request is a Customary Business Practice, no ICR would be needed.\n\n- An EPA
    employee or a contractor needs to gather information on certain products, such
    as how they are packaged and what types of wastes are produced in the manufacture
    of these products and after product use. The company has brochures and Material
    Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on these products and a report on a waste survey of
    its members. This material is available to the public upon request.\n\n- An ICR
    is not needed for product brochures, MSDS sheets or the survey results provided
    in existing formats. An ICR would be needed to collect new data on the types and
    quantities of wastes or packaging data or for re-assembling existing data in a
    new format.\n\n##Market Sector\n##American (y/n) \n##Customary Business Practices\n\n__Examples__\n"

    ##Social Media Exceptions

    __Background__

    The PRA was created to protect the public from burdensome, unnecessary, low-utility or duplicative Federal requests for information. While the PRA never envisioned how government would use technological developments such as social media, these decidedly non-paperwork-related technologies are nonetheless subject to the provisions of the Act, which applies “regardless of form or format.”

    Prior approval must be obtained from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before EPA can ask for most types of information from the public. Approval is obtained through submission of an Information Collection Request (ICR), which is generally a substantial undertaking that requires 6-9 months on average to complete.

    However, not all public responses to agency solicitations constitute “information collections” depending on their format and use. Many (though not all) uses of social media fall outside the scope of the PRA, as outlined below. These same guidelines may also be applied to questions asked in traditional off-line formats, which may be structured so as to avoid the need for an ICR.

    ICRs are required whenever identical or substantially similar information is gathered by or for EPA from 10 or more non-Federal entities, regardless of whether a collection is voluntary or mandatory. As social media uses are open to large numbers of people, ICRs can only be avoided if either of the following are true: The solicitation does not seek “identical” information, or qualify as “information” (per OMB’s definition).

    __Tips for Avoiding an ICR__

      - Do Not Request “Information”
    OMB has specifically stated that submissions made via many social media platforms do not quality as "information" because they fall under longstanding exemptions for:

       - General Solicitations. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(4) excludes "facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations of comments from the public, published in the Federal Register or other publications, regardless of the form or format thereof, provided that no person is required to supply specific information pertaining to the commenter, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a condition of the agency’s full consideration of the comment."
     - Public Meetings. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(8) excludes certain "facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with public hearings or meetings."
    Like Items. 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(h)(10) reserves general authority for OMB to identify other "like items" that are not "information."
     - __OMB's Guidance on Social Media memo__ provides greater detail, but in brief, public comments or submissions made via the following social media platforms generally fall under the exemptions above and DO NOT require an ICR (within the stated limitations).

    OMB defines as “identical” those questions for which each respondent or group of respondents (e.g., in a focus group) is being asked to provide the same level of information on the same subject. Identical questions need not be phrased exactly the same way each time they are asked, nor does each respondent need to be asked the same “set of questions.” For this reason, we often characterize “identical” as meaning “substantially similar”.

    The following “creative” attempts to circumvent this definition are not valid and require an ICR:

    Rephrasing questions for different respondents.
    Breaking up a list of questions among 10 or more respondents so that each question is only asked of 9 or fewer respondents.
    Enlisting surrogates (such as Regions, States, Contractors or Grantees) to each gather the information from 9 or fewer people. (e.g. even if 10 Regions each ask 5 people the same question, it counts as 50 respondents).

    __How can I collect information without having to do an ICR?__

    The Social Media Guide provides some creative ways to collect information without triggering the need for an ICR.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that any federal agency collecting similar information from 10 or more members of the public will require an OMB approved ICR. So, one way you can collect that information is by contacting fewer than 10 respondents. Another option available is to hold a public meeting where you can ask for general solicitation."
    "How to Ask Questions and Use Social Media Without Triggering an Information Collection Request (Word)
    “The PRA defines and uses ‘collection of information’ very broadly  to mean ‘the obtaining, causing to be obtained, solicitation or requiring the disclosure to third parties or the public’ of facts of opinions ‘regardless of the form or format’ used. ”Implementing Guidance for OMB Review of Agency Information Collection, June 2, 1999, Discussion of what is not considered “information” is contained on pages 23-28.

    __Can I provide compensation (gift, incentives) to respondents?__

    Yes but only in exceptional cases. Incentives should only be considered in the context of a rigorously designed and professionally implemented survey. They may not be used to offset the effects of poor questionnaires, inadequate follow-up or other deficiencies that unnecessarily compromise respondent cooperation.

    Compensation is not uncommon for focus group participants, but should rarely be used for other types of surveys. Any compensation given to respondents must be well justified within the justification document.

    __Brief Guidelines for Nonspecific/Nondirective Questions__

    Asking questions in a nonspecific/nondirective way may mean that you won’t always get exactly what you’re looking for, and won’t let you aggregate responses for statistical purposes. That’s the whole point: if you need comparable responses, then you need an ICR.

    The following table lists commonly used types of online solicitations and whether or not the PRA applies to them. For more information, consult OMB's Guidance on Social Media.

    __Asking Non-“Identical” questions the right way__

    OMB does not consider the following to be “identical”: Nonspecific or nondirective questions   such as those that ask for “facts or opinions” that the respondent wishes to provide on a specific topic without further specification of the information being sought or the form that a response should take.

    For example, a nondirective request for a respondent’s experience with a Federal program or a request for comment on a published report would appear to be so general as not to be “identical.” Such nondirective questions ask respondents to choose the information to be provided or recorded, and each respondent may choose to interpret the collection of information differently.

    A general solicitation (as described in the previous section) may pose a series of specific questions designed to elicit relevant public feedback; but the solicitation may not be a survey and the responses should be unstructured. Surveys of any kind, including web polls and satisfaction surveys that pose identical, specific questions (including through pop-up windows) are subject to the PRA.

    Nonstandardized oral inquiries--i.e., inquiries that do not follow a plan used to obtain “identical” information from ten or more persons--are also not considered to be “identical.”

    The Paperwork Reduction Act was intended to reduce the burden on the public from unnecessary, poorly designed and duplicative requests for information from the federal government. This is achieved by requiring an agency to get OMB approval (via an Information Collection Request) before collecting similar information from 10 or more non-federal persons or entities.
    This law applies even to small, simple & voluntary information collections, such as a conference or website survey. In response to the impracticality of creating an ICR for such collections, a ""generic ICR"" was created, which pre-approves a class of similar, low-burden surveys and guarantees simplified and expedited OMB review for individual requests.
    Notwithstanding this approval of the overall collection, each individual survey must still be submitted to OMB. Once OMB receives the new survey request, they will have 5 business days to either approve the collection or flag a concern that needs to be addressed.

    __PRA Language for Preambles__

    The preamble for each of the Agency's proposed and final rules must contain a discussion of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Please use the template below to assist you in drafting this portion of the preamble.

    ##PRA Requirements

    __What is the 40 CFR part 9 Table?__

    It is a table with two columns; one column for the 40 CFR regulatory citations of information collection requirements and the other for the OMB control number. The tables can be found at the end of every volume of title 40 of the CFR.

    __Why is this table important?__

    EPA enforcement attorneys, administrative law judges, and the public use 40 CFR part 9 to determine if a regulatory recordkeeping, reporting, or other regulatory information collection requirement has an OMB control number.

    __What do I need to do?__

    When OMB approves an ICR after a final rule is published in the Federal Register (FR), prepare and send the following documents to the ICR team along with the final rule ICR package:
    A draft FR document for a 40 CFR part 9 Technical Amendment.
    A separate FR Typesetting Request Form to pay for publishing the amendment in the FR.
    When OMB approves an ICR before a final rule is published in the FR (uncommon):
    Display the OMB control number in the preamble for the rule published in the FR and
    Include an amendment for 40 CFR part 9 as part of the rule in order to add to or revise the list of OMB control numbers or CFR citations (see regulatory text section of attachment)

    ##1st Notice

    The 1st Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with an ICR's data and published in the Federal Register. The notice is posted for 60 days.

    ##2nd Notice

    The 2nd Federal Register Notice Template gets filled out with the ICR's data and then is submitted to OEI for publishing. This notice is posted for 30 days. Learn more.

    ##FR Process for New ICR

    For a new ICR that is not part of a rulemaking, follow the same process as the renewal ICRs.

    ##FR Process for Proposed Rule

    For proposed rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list any new information collection requirements. Proposed rules with new information collections follow Template A of the rule preamble guidance.

    ##FR Process for Final Rule

    For final rules, the Paperwork Reduction Act section should list the EPA ICR number as well as the assigned OMB control number. Final Rules may follow either one of the templates in the rule preamble guidance.

    ##FR Process for Renewals

    Nine months prior to an ICR's expiration date, programs should begin working on their renewal packages.
    - Start going over the previous collection by talking with a few respondents to get a feel for the current levels of burden estimates.
    - Begin adjusting the burden hours, responses, and salary costs in the supporting statement to current levels.
    - Draft the 1st FR Notice with the ICR's current data.
    - Submit the 1st FR Notice and Typesetting Request Form to the FR Office (contacts listed on right, or send them an e-mail).
    - 1st FR Notice should publish 6 months prior to ICR's expiration date.
    - After the 1st FR Notice publishes, finalize the renewal package by completing the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.

    ##General FAQ

    __Why do I need to contact the Federal Register Office?__
    For a renewal of an Information Collection Request, program offices publish the 1st Federal Register Notice at least 6 months prior to the ICR's expiration date. The current templates are available on the Federal Register Notices page. For the 2nd Federal Register notice, program offices complete the notice and email it, along with the rest of their ICR package, to their ICR Desk Officer. For ICR renewals, this step would take place between 3 and 4 months prior to the ICR's expiration date.

    __How do I publish a Federal Register Notice?__
    For the 1st Federal Register Notice, fill out the 1st FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Then, submit the 1st FR Notice, a Typesetting Request, and an Action Information Sheet to the Office of Policy s, Office of the Federal Register (OFR). See their Federal Register Publishing intranet site for more details, templates, and contact information.
    For the 2nd Federal Register Notice, fill out the 2nd FR Notice Template with the ICR's current data. Upon the close of the 60 day comment period, e-mail the Supporting Statement, ICR Submission Worksheet, and 2nd FR Notice to the ICR Desk Officer.
